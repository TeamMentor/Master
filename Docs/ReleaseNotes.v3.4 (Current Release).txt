CONTENT CHANGES

The TeamMentor 3.4 release includes the following content changes:
+ New SCALA library - an exclusive SCALA secure application development library. There are very few resources focused on SCALA security at the moment, so this is one of the first.
+ New HTML5 Library - a new library that describes important aspects of writing secure HTML5 applications. Both server-side and client-side issues are considered and guidance is provided on how to prevent or fix them.
+ New Vulnerability Library - a new library used to interface with vulnerability scanners. The Vulnerability library is a set of pages that describe most common vulnerabilities and leads to guidance on how to prevent or fix these vulnerabilities.
+ Multiple content fixes - most importantly, the recommended way to store passwords is to use iterative hashing now and the content has been updated to reflect this in ASP.NET 4.0, Java, PHP and C++ libraries. Multiple minor fixes have been made, such as removing outdated links from the ASP.NET 4.0 library.
