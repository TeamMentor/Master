Verify that sensitive data is not cached.

==Why==

Avoid caching sensitive data to prevent this data from falling into the wrong hands if the device is stolen or compromised.

==How to Check==

To verify that sensitive data is not cached:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of types of sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:
#* Passwords
#* Encryption keys
#* Personal information
# **Identify code that creates temporary files used by the application.** Review the application source code to find functions that are responsible for creating the temporary files to find ones that write sensitive data.
# **Verify that sensitive data is not cached.** Examine the code that creates temporary files used by the application to make sure that sensitive data is not stored in them.

==How to Fix==

To prevent caching of sensitive data:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of types of sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:
#* Passwords
#* Encryption keys
#* Personal information
# **Identify code that creates temporary files used by the application.** Review the application source code to find functions that are responsible for creating the temporary files to find ones that write sensitive data.
# **Remove code that writes sensitive data to temporary files.** Edit the functions that write sensitive data to temporary files to prevent caching of sensitive data.
