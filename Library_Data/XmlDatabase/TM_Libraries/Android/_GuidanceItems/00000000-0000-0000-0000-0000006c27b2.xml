Verify that location data is not logged.

==Why==

Logging location data is likely to raise privacy concerns among users.

==How to Check==

To verify that location data is not logged:

# **Identify whether the application uses location services.**
# **Determine how location services are used.** Trace location data from source to sink and record each operation performed on it.
# **Verify that location data is not logged.** Examine the trace of location data from source to sink to make sure that location data is not being logged either on the device or on any remote server.

==How to Fix==

If your application uses location data, do not store it in files and do not send it to remote servers.
