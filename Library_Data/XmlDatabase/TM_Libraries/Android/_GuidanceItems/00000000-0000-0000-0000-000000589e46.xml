Encrypt authentication credentials sent over the network. Using SSL is the simplest way to protect the authentication process.

==Why==

Encrypting authentication credentials sent over the network helps prevent various man-in-the-middle attacks, such as spoofing or hijacking.

==How==

To encrypt authentication credentials sent over the network:

# **Identify the authentication mechanism used by the application.** Most applications use usernames and passwords for authentication, however there are other options available, such as certificates. 
# **Identify the authentication code.** Identify the code that is responsible for authentication both on the iOS device and on the remote server. The authentication itself should be implemented on the server. To protect authentication credentials in transit, both end points need to support SSL. 
# **Encrypt authentication credentials in transit.** Add code that uses SSL to protect authentication credentials in transit.
