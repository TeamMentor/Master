Verify that data inserted into XML documents is validated and encoded.

==Why==

Validating and encoding data inserted into XML documents helps prevent XML injection vulnerabilities.

==How to Check==

To verify that data inserted into XML documents is validated and encoded:

# **Identify XML documents used by the application.** Examine the application design to identify all XML documents and XML document types used by the application.
# **Identify code that uses XML documents.** Review application code to find code that uses XML documents.
# **Review validation code.** Make sure there are clear validation functions defined for each type of XML data handled by the application.
# **Review encoding code.** Make sure there are encoding functions defined for XML data. Consider the following when evaluating XML encoding: data has to be converted to a uniform character encoding first, XML entities have to be escaped properly, and code that loads XML documents should be able to restore the original data from the encoded data.
# **Verify that validation and encoding are used.** Make sure that all XML data is validated and encoded before being inserted into XML documents.

==How to Fix==

To validate and encode data inserted into XML documents:

# **Identify XML documents used by the application.** Examine the application design to identify all XML documents and XML document types used by the application.
# **Identify code that uses XML documents.** Review application code to find code that uses XML documents.
# **Add data validation code.** Add methods that validate all the data types that are stored in XML documents and used by the application.
# **Use validation code.** Add code that uses the data validation methods from the previous step to code that uses XML documents. Validation should be performed before encoding.
# **Add encoding code.** Add methods that escape XML entities. Unfortunately, there are no stable libraries available for escaping XML entities for iOS. When writing code that escapes XML entities, consider the following: data has to be converted to a uniform character encoding first, XML entities have to be escaped properly, and code that loads XML documents should be able to restore the original data from the encoded data.
# **Use encoding code.** Add code that encodes data to code that uses XML documents.
