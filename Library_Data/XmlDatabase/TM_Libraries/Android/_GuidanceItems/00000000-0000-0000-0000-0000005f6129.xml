Verify that parsing of external XML entities is disabled.

==Why==

Parsing external entities in XML documents may result in injection vulnerabilities.

==How to Check==

To verify that parsing of external XML entities is disabled:

# **Identify the XML parser used by the application.** Find out which XML parser is used by the application. Some common Android XML parsers are: //SAXParser//, //XmlPullParser// and //DocumentBuilder//.
# **Verify that parsing of external XML entities is disabled.** //DocumentBuilder// and //XmlPullParser// don't support external XML entities. If //SAXParser// is used, make sure that //external-general-entities// and //external-parameter-entities// feature flags have not been enabled.

==How to Fix==

There are multiple parsing packages built into the Android SDK: //SAXParser//, //XmlPullParser// and //DocumentBuilder//.

//DocumentBuilder// doesn't support external XML entities.

//XmlPullParser// doesn't support external XML entities.

//SAXParser// has parsing of external XML entities disabled by default. Parsing of external XML entities is configured in //SAXParser// using //external-general-entities// and //external-parameter-entities// feature flags. Please, make sure that these flags are not enabled by the application.
