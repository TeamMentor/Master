Verify that cached data is deleted after use.

==Why==

If the device is lost or compromised, cached data may be recovered by attackers.

==How to Check==

==How to Fix==

To delete cached data after use:

# **Identify cached data.** Make a list of all data cached by the application. Find code that is responsible for each peace of data that is cached.
# **Do not cache sensitive data.** Examine code that caches data to verify that sensitive data is not cached.
# **Add code that removes cached data.** For all code that caches data, make sure that there is code that removes the data that has been cached.
