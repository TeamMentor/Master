Use SSL to secure network communications.

==Why==

Using SSL to secure network communications prevents eavesdropping attacks.

==How==

To use SSL to protect network connections:

# **Identify all communications performed by the application.** Review the application design to identify all network communications that are performed by the application.
# **Define communication security requirements.** Define which network communications need to be encrypted. All transmissions that include sensitive data should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.
# **Identify code that uses the network.** Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.
# **Add code that uses SSL.** There are multiple methods for using SSL in Android to choose from based on application requirements. Using the //SSLSocketFactory// class is one of the most common solutions.
