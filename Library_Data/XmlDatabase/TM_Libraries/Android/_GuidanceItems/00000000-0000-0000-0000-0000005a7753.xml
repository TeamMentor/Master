Verify that sensitive data is not logged.

==Why==

If sensitive data is logged, it may be recovered by an attacker if the device is lost or compromised.

==How to Check==

To verify that sensitive data is not logged:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of types of sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:
#* Passwords
#* Encryption keys
#* Personal information
# **Review logging code.** Identify code that generates log entries by searching for references to the //Log// class. Review this code to verify that it does not include sensitive information in log entries.

==How to Fix==

To prevent logging of sensitive data:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of types of sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:
#* Passwords
#* Encryption keys
#* Personal information
# **Identify logging code.** Find all code that uses the //Log// class. 
# **Review logging code.** Examine logging code to make sure that it never includes sensitive data in log entries.
