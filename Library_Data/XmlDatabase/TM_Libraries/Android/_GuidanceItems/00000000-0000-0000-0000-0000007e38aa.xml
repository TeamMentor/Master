* Android applications that use SQL databases.

==What to Check For==

Verify that parameterized methods are used for database access.

==Why==

Using parameterized query methods for database access prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities.

==How to Check==

To verify that parameterized methods are used for database access:

# **Identify all code that executes SQL queries.** Review application code to find all queries that are executed by the application and the code that executes them.
# **Verify that parameterized APIs are used to execute SQL queries.** Make sure that data is passed to queries as parameters. Make sure that data, especially untrusted data, is never concatenated with the query strings and then executed.

==How to Fix==

The Android API includes parameterized functions for querying SQLite databases. Avoid using the rawQuery method, because it may be used in a manner that introduces SQL injection vulnerabilities, by including untrusted input in the SQL query string.

Use the following method for SELECT statements:

*//query//

Use the following methods for INSERT statements:

*//insert//
*//insertOrThrow//
*//insertWithOnConflict//

Use the following methods for UPDATE statements:

*//update//
*//updateWithOnConflict//

Use the following method for DELETE statements:

*//delete//

If your application uses some other API, please make sure that it uses parameterized methods for database access.
