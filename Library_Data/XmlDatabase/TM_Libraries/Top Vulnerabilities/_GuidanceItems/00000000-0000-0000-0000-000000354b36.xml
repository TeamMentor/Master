    <Data><![CDATA[<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or
 by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>It is easy to modify the behavior of the client or just write a new client that does not observe the same data validation rules.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All applications should only use server-side validation when the code relies on security.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Server-side code should perform its own validation. What if an attacker bypasses your client, or shuts off your client-side script routines, for example, by disabling JavaScript? Use client-side validation to help reduce the number of round trips to the
 server but do not rely on it for security. This is an example of defense in depth.</p>
