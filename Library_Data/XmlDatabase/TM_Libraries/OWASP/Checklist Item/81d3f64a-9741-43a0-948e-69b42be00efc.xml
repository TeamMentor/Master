    <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that failed logon attempts are audited to detect and trace suspicious behavior.</p>
  <br />
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>You must log failed logon attempts to be able to detect and trace suspicious behavior.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>To audit failed logon attempts</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start the Local Security Policy tool from the Administrative Tools program group.
</li>
    <li>Expand <strong>Local Policies</strong> and then select <strong>Audit Policy</strong></li>
    <li>Double-click <strong>Audit account logon events</strong>. </li>
    <li>Click <strong>Failure</strong> and then <strong>OK</strong>. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Logon failures are recorded as events in the Windows security event log. The following event IDs are suspicious:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>531</strong>. This means an attempt was made to log on using a disabled account.
</li>
    <li>
      <strong>529</strong>. This means an attempt was made to log on using an unknown user account or using a valid user account but with an invalid password. An unexpected increase in the number of these audit events might indicate an attempt to guess passwords.
</li>
  </ul>
