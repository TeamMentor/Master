Unvalidated redirection vulnerabilities allow attackers to craft URLs that appear to lead to a legitimate site, but actually lead to a malicious site. An attacker may be able to leverage this vulnerability to trick users into entering sensitive information into a malicious website while seemingly navigating within a trusted website.

==Countermeasures==

The following TeamMentor articles describe effective counter-measures against unvalidated redirection vulnerabilities:

* [[Don't Use Redirects Or Forwards If Possible]]
* [[Calculate Destinations of Redirects And Forwards Without User Input]]
* [[Use Mapping Values When Redirecting on User Input]]
* [[Validate Destinations of Redirects And Forwards]]

==Checklists==

The following checklist items can help make sure that effective counter-measures against unvalidated redirection vulnerabilities have been implemented:

* [[Redirects And Forwards Are Not Used If Possible]]
* [[Destinations of Redirects And Forwards Are Calculated Without User Input]]
* [[Mapping Values Are Used for Redirects And Forwards]]
* [[Destinations of Redirects And Forwards Are Validated]]
