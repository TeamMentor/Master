LDAP injection is a type of vulnerabilities that allows attackers to view, modify, or remove information from LDAP directories. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a widely used protocol for accessing directory services. Directories provide a set of attributes about people that are organized in a hierarchal manner, for example the phone directory. LDAP injection vulnerabilities typically occur as a result of concatenating user input with LDAP query strings.
