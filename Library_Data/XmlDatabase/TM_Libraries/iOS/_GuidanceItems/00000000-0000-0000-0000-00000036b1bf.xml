*iOS applications that use XML documents.

==What to Check For==

Verify that parsing of external XML entities is disabled.

==Why==

Parsing external entities in XML documents may result in injection vulnerabilities.

==How to Check==

To verify that parsing of external XML entities is disabled:

# **Identify the XML parsing library used by the application.** There are two common libraries used in iOS applications for parsing XML: //NSXMLParser// and //LibXML2//.
# **Examine code that uses //NSXMLParser//.** Parsing of external entities is disabled by default in //NSXMLParser//. Search for the //setShouldResolveExternalEntities// option to make sure it is not used to enable parsing of external XML entities.
# **Examine code that uses //LibXML2//.** Parsing of external entitites needs to be manually disabled in //LibXML2//. Search for the //xmlSetExternalEntityLoader// method of the //parser// class to make sure that it is declared in a way that prevents loading of external XML entities.

==How to Fix==

There are two common ways to parse XML in iOS: //NSXMLParser// and //LibXML2//. 

# **//NSXMLParser//.** Parsing of external entities is disabled by default in //NSXMLParser//. Don't explicitly enable parsing of external entities - avoid using the //setShouldResolveExternalEntities// option. 
# **//LibXML2//.** Parsing of external entitites needs to be manually disabled in //LibXML2//. To disable parsing of external entities, use the //xmlSetExternalEntityLoader// method of the //parser// class to set the external entity loader to be a function that doesn't do anything.]]></Data>
