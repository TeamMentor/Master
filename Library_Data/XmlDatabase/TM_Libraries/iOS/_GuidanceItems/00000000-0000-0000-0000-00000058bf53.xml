Verify that sensitive data is not logged.

==Why==

If sensitive data is logged, it may be recovered by an attacker if the device is lost or compromised.

==How to Check==

To verify that sensitive data is not logged:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of types of sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:
#* Passwords
#* Encryption keys
#* Personal information
# **Review logging code.** Identify code that generates log entries by searching for //NSLog()// function calls. Review this code to verify that it does not include sensitive information in log entries.

==How to Fix==

To prevent logging of sensitive data:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of types of sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:
#* Passwords
#* Encryption keys
#* Personal information
# **Review logging code.** Identify code that generates log entries by searching for //NSLog()// function calls. Review this code to verify that it does not include sensitive information in log entries. If necessary, rewrite this code in a way that does not log sensitive data. If //NSLog()// calls are necessary for debugging, they can be conditionally commented out using //#define// directives.
