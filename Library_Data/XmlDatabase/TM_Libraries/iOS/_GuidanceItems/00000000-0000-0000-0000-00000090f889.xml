Verify that URL handlers are not used for sensitive operations.

==Why==

URL handlers may be abused in Cross-Site Scripting attacks. If URL handlers are used for sensitive operations, such sensitive operations may be exploited in Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

==How to Check==

To verify that URL handlers are not used for sensitive operations:

# **Identify all URL handlers used by the application.** Examine the application .plist file for //URL Types// defined by the application. These //URL Types// correspond to URL handlers used by the application.
# **Identify the operations associated with the URL handlers.** The developers should know what each //URL Type// is responsible for. 
# **Verify that URL handlers are not used for sensitive operations.** Examine each URL handler to decide whether it is safe to keep. 
# **Verify that URL handlers validate the origin of the URL request.** For URL handlers that are necessary for the application, make sure the //openURL// method is used.


==How to Fix==

To avoid using URL handlers for sensitive operations:

# **Identify all URL handlers used by the application.** Examine the application .plist file for //URL Types// defined by the application. These //URL Types// correspond to URL handlers used by the application.
# **Identify the operations associated with the URL handlers.** The developers should know what each //URL Type// is responsible for. Consider each one and decide if it is safe to keep.
# **Remove dangerous URL handlers.** Sometimes URL handlers are used for testing. Remove any URL handlers that may be too dangerous from the production release.
# **Verify the origin of the URL request**. Use the //openURL// method to make sure the URL request came from within the application itself or from a trusted application for any remaining URL handlers.
