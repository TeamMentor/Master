Verify that data passed to //UIWebView// controls is validated and encoded.

==Why==

Validating data passed to //UIWebView// controls helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. //UIWebView// controls are capable of executing JavaScript passed to them. If unvalidated data is passed to //UIWebView// controls, it may be possible for an attacker to pass malicious JavaScript, which will then be executed in the context of the application.

==How to Check==

To verify that data passed to //UIWebView// controls is validated and encoded:

# **Identify data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Examine the application design and identify what types of data are handled by //UIWebView// controls, if any.
# **Identify code that passes data to //UIWebView// controls.** Review code to identify all //UIWebView// controls used by the application and code that passes data that may include JavaScript to them. Trouble areas may be found by searching for //stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString// method calls.
# **Identify and review validation code for data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Make sure there are validation methods for each type of data that is passed to //UIWebView// controls. Pay particular attention to any data that may include JavaScript.
# **Identify and review encoding code for data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Make sure there are encoding methods for each context of data that is passed to //UIWebView// controls. Unfortunately, there appear to be no standard libraries that handle encoding for iOS. Things to watch out for are: converting data to the same character-encoding before validating or encoding, escaping HTML entities, escaping JavaScript entities, and escaping XML entities, depending on context.
# **Verify that validation and encoding are performed on all data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Make sure that all data passed to //UIWebView// controls is validated and encoded.

==How to Fix==

To validate data passed to //UIWebView// controls:

# **Identify data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Examine the application design and identify what types of data are handled by //UIWebView// controls, if any.
# **Identify code that passes data to //UIWebView// controls.** Review code to identify all //UIWebView// controls used by the application and code that passes data that may include JavaScript to them. Trouble areas may be found by searching for //stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString// method calls.
# **Write validation code for data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Add data validation methods to the application that validate all data types sent to //UIWebView// controls used by the application. Pay particular attention to any data that may include JavaScript.
# **Write encoding code for data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Write encoding routines that handle all the types of data that are passed to //UIWebView// controls. Unfortunately, there appear to be no standard libraries that handle encoding for iOS. Things to watch out for are: converting data to the same character-encoding before validating or encoding, escaping HTML entities, escaping JavaScript entities, and escaping XML entities, depending on context.
# **Validate and encode data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Use the respective validation and encoding functions for each respective type of data before passing it to //UIWebView// controls.

==Data Validation Guidelines==
* [[Canonicalize File Names and Paths]]
* [[Check File Paths and Names for Null Bytes]]
* [[Validate All Input]]
* [[Validate and Encode Data Inserted into XML Documents]]
* [[Validate and Encode Data Passed to UIWebView Controls]]
* [[Validate File Formats]]

==Data Validation Checklists==
* [[File Names and Paths Are Canonicalized]]
* [[File Paths and Names Are Checked for Null Bytes]]
* [[All Input Is Validated]]
* [[Data Inserted into XML Documents Is Validated and Encoded]]
* [[Data Passed to UIWebView Controls Is Validated and Encoded]]
* [[File Formats Are Validated]]
