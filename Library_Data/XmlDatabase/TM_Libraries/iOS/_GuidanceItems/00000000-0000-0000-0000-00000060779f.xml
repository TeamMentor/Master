* iOS applications that send or receive sensitive data over the network.

==What to Do==

Use SSL to protect network communications.

==Why==

Properly using SSL to encrypt network communications prevents eavesdropping attacks. Other types of Man-in-the-middle attacks may also be prevented by using SSL.

==How==

To use SSL to protect communications:

# **Identify all communications performed by the application.** Review the application design to identify all network communications that are performed by the application.
# **Define communication security requirements.** Define which network communications need to be encrypted. All transmissions that include sensitive data should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.
# **Identify code that uses the network.** Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.
# **Add code that uses SSL.** Add code that uses SSL to code that performs network communications that need to be encrypted. The //NSURLRequest// and //NSURLConnection// classes support SSL with an acceptably secure default configuration starting with iOS 5 - this is the most practical way to use SSL on iOS and should be sufficient for most applications. 

==Communication Security Guidelines==
* [[Disable Self-signed SSL Certificates]]
* [[Use SSL to Protect Communications]]
* [[Use Strong SSL Configurations]]

==Communication Security Checklists==
* [[Self-signed SSL Certificates Are Disabled]]
* [[SSL Is Used to Protect Communications]]
* [[Strong SSL Configurations Are Used]]
