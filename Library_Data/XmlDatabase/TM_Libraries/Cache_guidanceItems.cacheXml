Use SSL to secure network communications.

==Why==

Using SSL to secure network communications prevents eavesdropping attacks.

==How==

To use SSL to protect network connections:

# **Identify all communications performed by the application.** Review the application design to identify all network communications that are performed by the application.
# **Define communication security requirements.** Define which network communications need to be encrypted. All transmissions that include sensitive data should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.
# **Identify code that uses the network.** Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.
# **Add code that uses SSL.** There are multiple methods for using SSL in Android to choose from based on application requirements. Using the //SSLSocketFactory// class is one of the most common solutions.

      <Data><![CDATA[==What to Check For==

Verify that parsing of external XML entities is disabled.

==Why==

Parsing external entities in XML documents may result in injection vulnerabilities.

==How to Check==

To verify that parsing of external XML entities is disabled:

# **Identify the XML parser used by the application.** Find out which XML parser is used by the application. Some common Android XML parsers are: //SAXParser//, //XmlPullParser// and //DocumentBuilder//.
# **Verify that parsing of external XML entities is disabled.** //DocumentBuilder// and //XmlPullParser// don't support external XML entities. If //SAXParser// is used, make sure that //external-general-entities// and //external-parameter-entities// feature flags have not been enabled.

==How to Fix==

There are multiple parsing packages built into the Android SDK: //SAXParser//, //XmlPullParser// and //DocumentBuilder//.

//DocumentBuilder// doesn't support external XML entities.

//XmlPullParser// doesn't support external XML entities.

//SAXParser// has parsing of external XML entities disabled by default. Parsing of external XML entities is configured in //SAXParser// using //external-general-entities// and //external-parameter-entities// feature flags. Please, make sure that these flags are not enabled by the application.

Verify that applications are signed.

==Why==

Signing the application binary helps verify that the application came from a trusted source.

==How to Check==

If applications are not signed properly, they will not run. To verify that an application is signed:

# **Install the application.** Follow the standard procedure to install the application.
# **Run the application.** Once the application is installed, launch it. If the application runs, then it has been signed successfully.

==How to Fix==

To sign Android applications:

# **Generate a private key.** Use the //keytool// command to generate a suitable private key. The key has to represent the entity responsible for the application. The key has to have a validity period that ends after 22 October 2033. The key should be different from the debug key. It is okay for the key to be self-signed. More information about using the //keytool// command is available at the link in the Additional Resources section.
# **Protect the private key.** The private key should be kept secret to prevent attackers from signing malicious applications with it. Applications that are signed with the same private key appear to come from the same source and a crafty attacker may take advantage of that by passing malicious applications off as yours.
# **Build the application.** Build the application in release mode. The application is not signed automatically. Export the unsigned APK package.
# **Sign the application.** Use the //Jarsigner// tool to sign the application package.  More information about using the //Jarsigner// command is available at the link in the Additional Resources section.
# **Align the package.** Use the //zipalign// command to align the signed APK. More information about using the //zipalign// command is available at the link in the Additional Resources section.

      <Data><![CDATA[==What to Do==

Use parameterized query methods for database access.

==Why==

Using parameterized query methods for database access prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities.

==How==

The Android API includes parameterized functions for querying SQLite databases. Avoid using the rawQuery method, because it may be used in a manner that introduces SQL injection vulnerabilities, by including untrusted input in the SQL query string.

Use the following method for SELECT statements:

*//query//

Use the following methods for INSERT statements:

*//insert//
*//insertOrThrow//
*//insertWithOnConflict//

Use the following methods for UPDATE statements:

*//update//
*//updateWithOnConflict//

Use the following method for DELETE statements:

*//delete//

If your application uses some other API, please make sure that it uses parameterized methods for database access.

Verify that stored sensitive data is encrypted.

==Why==

Sensitive data at rest should be encrypted to make it difficult for an attacker to recover this data in the event that the device is stolen or compromised.

==How to Check==

To verify that stored sensitive data is encrypted:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of types of sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are.
# **Determine if sensitive data needs to be stored.** For each type of sensitive data, determine whether it needs to be stored at all. Do not store sensitive data unless it is absolutely necessary. For data that needs to be stored, make a list of the locations where it is stored and which functions access each piece of sensitive data.
# **Review encryption requirements for sensitive data that is stored in files.** Determine the level of protection that is the most appropriate for each type of sensitive data handled by the application that is stored in files.
# **Verify that stored sensitive data is encrypted.** Examine the code that is responsible for storing each type of data that needs to be encrypted to make sure that it satisfies the defined encryption requirements.

==How to Fix==

To encrypt stored sensitive data:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of types of sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are.
# **Determine if sensitive data needs to be stored.** For each type of sensitive data, determine whether it needs to be stored at all. Do not store sensitive data unless it is absolutely necessary. For data that needs to be stored, make a list of the locations where it is stored and which functions access each piece of sensitive data.
# **Add an encryption subsystem to your application.** Implement a centralized set of encryption functions to be used by your application. A centralized encryption subsystem is simpler to manage and to implement correctly than ad hoc code spread out throughout the application. The encryption system should provide encryption and decryption functions; functions for managing the encryption keys might also be useful.
# **Use the //Cipher// class for encryption.** The Android SDK includes the //Cipher// class, which provides access to industry standard cryptographic algorithms.
# **Use a strong encryption algorithm and mode.** Use the //getInstance// method of the //Cipher// class to specify an encryption algorithm and mode. One recommended algorithm and mode is //"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"//. 
# **Use strong encryption keys.** Make sure to use strong encryption keys when protecting sensitive data. The most important factor in encryption key strength is length. The recommended length of encryption keys for the AES algorithm is 256-bit. Pass the key as a byte array to the constructor of the //SecretKeySpec// class to get a //SecretKeySpec// object that can be used with the //Cipher// for encryption or decryption. The key may be generated by using the //KeyGenerator// class.
# **Explicitly specify character encoding.** Make sure to explicitly specify the character encoding when encrypting and decrypting data by using the //Charset.forName// method.
# **Use //CipherOutputStream// and //CipherInputStream// classes to access encrypted streams.** The //CipherOutputStream// and //CipherInputStream// classes provide cryptographic wrappers for stream objects - this might be simpler to use for cryptographic I/O than using the //Cipher// class directly for each byte.
# **Use your application's encryption subsystem to encrypt stored sensitive data.** Once your encryption subsystem has been defined, use it to protect all files that store sensitive data. Encryption functions need to be called whenever sensitive data is stored and decryption functions need to be called whenever sensitive data is loaded.

Sign updates to the application.

==Why==

Sign updates to the application to help verify that the updates came from a trusted party.

==How==

Signing updates is an important principle in software development to prevent malicious software from masquerading as updates to legitimate software. In practice, updates to mobile software are usually distributed as complete new versions, rather than as patches to the already installed software. The updated software package is usually signed because otherwise it won't be allowed on the most popular distribution channels. Therefore, the process for signing mobile software and updates is usually already established by software developers. It is still important to be aware of the importance of signing software and software updates.

Verify that file sharing is disabled in applications by default.

==Why==

Disable file sharing to prevent unauthorized access. If file sharing is necessary, it should only be enabled when it is being used.

==How to Check==

To verify that file sharing is disabled:

# **Identify file sharing functionality.** Determine whether the application implements file sharing and if so, find the code that implements it.
# **Verify that file sharing is disabled by default.** Check the default settings to make sure that file sharing is disabled by default.

==How to Fix==

To disable file sharing by default.

# **Identify file sharing functionality.** Determine whether the application implements file sharing and if so, find the code that implements it.
# **Disable file sharing by default.** Edit the code that implements file sharing to disable file sharing by default. Provide controls to the user to enable file sharing when needed. It is recommended to encrypt network connections used for file sharing. It is also recommended to protect file sharing with usernames and passwords and to allow the user to set the usernames and passwords that are allowed to access shared files.

* Android applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Check For==

Verify that authentication attempts are throttled.

==Why==

Throttling authentication attempts makes password guessing attacks less effective. Authentication throttling should be implemented on the server to be effective.

==How to Check==

# **Review authentication throttling requirements.** Determine the time-out period between each authentication attempt. A recommended time-out period is three seconds.
# **Identify authentication code.** Identify server-side code that is responsible for authentication.
# **Review authentication code.** Examine authentication code to make sure that repeated authentication attempts are throttled. Verify that log entries are generated that indicate multiple repeated failed authentication attempts. Make sure the application keeps track of clients that attempt to authenticate using IPs and session cookies.
# **Attempt logging into the application repeatedly.** Test authentication throttling by attempting to log in repeatedly and observing that there is a pause between being allowed to attempt to authenticate again.

==How to Fix==

To throttle authentication attempts:

# **Define authentication throttling requirements.** Define the time-out period between each authentication attempt. A recommended time-out period is three seconds.
# **Identify authentication code.** Identify server-side code that is responsible for authentication.
# **Add code that throttles authentication attempts.** Add server-side code to the authentication code identified in the previous step to wait for the required time period before handling another authentication request. Keep track of clients using IPs and session cookies to make it harder to bypass authentication throttling.

==What to Check For==

Verify that self-signed SSL certificates are disabled.

==Why==

Allowing the use of self-signed SSL certificates enables some types of man-in-the-middle attacks.

==How to Check==

Self-signed SSL certificates are disabled on Android by default. To verify that self-signed SSL certificates are disabled:

# **Search for code that allows self-signed SSL certificates.** Search application code for the presence of the //setDefaultHostnameVerifier// method call - the presence of this method call indicates that self-signed SSL certificates may be allowed.
# **Verify that self-signed SSL certificates are not allowed in production releases.** If self-signed SSL certificates are allowed for development purposes, make sure that they are disabled in production releases. The recommended way to disable development code in production releases is by using //#define// and //#ifdef// compiler directives.

==How to Fix==

Self-signed SSL certificates are disabled on Android by default. Do not allow them in production releases.

      <Data><![CDATA[==What to Do==

Encrypt stored sensitive data.

==Why==

Sensitive data at rest should be encrypted to make it difficult for an attacker to recover this data in the event that the device is stolen or compromised.

==How==

To encrypt stored sensitive data:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of types of sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are.
# **Determine if sensitive data needs to be stored.** For each type of sensitive data, determine whether it needs to be stored at all. Do not store sensitive data unless it is absolutely necessary. For data that needs to be stored, make a list of the locations where it is stored and which functions access each piece of sensitive data.
# **Add an encryption subsystem to your application.** Implement a centralized set of encryption functions to be used by your application. A centralized encryption subsystem is simpler to manage and to implement correctly than ad hoc code spread out throughout the application. The encryption system should provide encryption and decryption functions; functions for managing the encryption keys might also be useful.
# **Use the //Cipher// class for encryption.** The Android SDK includes the //Cipher// class, which provides access to industry standard cryptographic algorithms.
# **Use a strong encryption algorithm and mode.** Use the //getInstance// method of the //Cipher// class to specify an encryption algorithm and mode. One recommended algorithm and mode is //"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"//. 
# **Use strong encryption keys.** Make sure to use strong encryption keys when protecting sensitive data. The most important factor in encryption key strength is length. The recommended length of encryption keys for the AES algorithm is 256-bit. Pass the key as a byte array to the constructor of the //SecretKeySpec// class to get a //SecretKeySpec// object that can be used with the //Cipher// for encryption or decryption. The key may be generated by using the //KeyGenerator// class.
# **Explicitly specify character encoding.** Make sure to explicitly specify the character encoding when encrypting and decrypting data by using the //Charset.forName// method.
# **Use //CipherOutputStream// and //CipherInputStream// classes to access encrypted streams.** The //CipherOutputStream// and //CipherInputStream// classes provide cryptographic wrappers for stream objects - this might be simpler to use for cryptographic I/O than using the //Cipher// class directly for each byte.
# **Use your application's encryption subsystem to encrypt stored sensitive data.** Once your encryption subsystem has been defined, use it to protect all files that store sensitive data. Encryption functions need to be called whenever sensitive data is stored and decryption functions need to be called whenever sensitive data is loaded.

* Android applications that open saved files or documents.

==What to Do==

Verify that the format of the file is correct when opening saved files or documents.

==Why==

Many vulnerabilities are exploited via malformed documents supplied to the application. One particular vector of attack that is frequently used is embedding malformed documents in web pages - some applications are integrated into the web browser and will open malicious documents automatically in that scenario. Making sure that file format is valid before loading files into the application makes it harder to embed exploit code into documents.

==How==

Perform the following actions to validate file format before loading files into the application:

# **Define file format.** Specify valid values for all possible fields in all document types used by your applications. This information should be a part of project documentation and the developers may already have it.
# **Review code.** Search for code that loads saved files into the application. Examine the extents of the validation already being performed by the application. If some validation is already being performed, some code may be recycled for a more thorough validation routine.
# **Implement validation.** Write validation functions for all fields in all document types supported by the application.
# **Centralize validation.** Move the validation functions for all document fields to the centralized input and data validation class or library. Write a master file format validation function that calls all individual data field validation functions.
# **Use validation.** Go back to code that loads data files into the application. Remove any old validation code. Add code that calls the master file format validation function on all files being loaded before loading them into the application.]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[==Applies To==

* Android applications that access resources on a remote server.

==What to Check For==

Verify that role-based access control is used.

==Why==

Application roles allow administrators to group users into categories that need the same level of privileges. The mechanism provides an easy and clear way to discover and manage the least privileges necessary for the execution of a given task. It provides a more robust and flexible way of managing the application's users.

==How to Check==

To verify that role-based access control is used:

# **Understand the different types of users.** Enumerate the different types of users needed for the application. Understand how they will use the application and to which resources they will need access. Create a matrix (spreadsheet) mapping the actions each role is authorized to perform with the corresponding system components. Use this matrix (spreadsheet) to identify the different types of users according to the functionality they need. Creating a threat model may be a useful step to ensure that you correctly understand the implications of this matrix.
# **Verify that roles have been defined.** Determine which resources can be accessed by each role.
# **Verify that access control is implemented.** Examine code that accesses each type of resources to make sure that it performs access control checks before accessing the resource.
# **Verify that access control enforces defined roles.** Examine the code that performs access control checks to make sure that it enforces the defined roles.

==How to Fix==

Use the following steps when designing role-based security:

# **Understand the different types of users.** Enumerate the different types of users needed for the application. Understand how they will use the application and to which resources they will need access. Create a matrix mapping the actions each role is authorized to perform with the corresponding system components. Use this matrix to identify the different types of users according to the functionality they need. Creating a threat model may be a useful step to ensure that you correctly understand the implications of this matrix.
# **Establish the roles.** Define which resources can be accessed by each role. There are two approaches when enforcing role-based security - programmatic and declarative.
#* **The programmatic approach.** The programmatic approach to role-based security is written inside the code and provides additional runtime flexibility. It allows your application to dynamically create and assign roles so that user privileges can be granted and revoked without the need of restarting your application. When using the programmatic approach to role-based security, place access control checks at the appropriate locations in your application.
#* **The declarative approach.** The declarative approach to role-based security is done via the configuration files. It allows easy manageability as the declarations can be modified without having to recompile. By using the declarative approach, you can easily manage the security settings for large portions of the application without changing the source code.
# **Manage the users.** Assign the users into their respective user roles. The application should enforce the security policy according to the user roles instead of the actual user.

* Android applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Check For==

Verify that authentication is implemented on the server-side.

==Why==

Server-side authentication should be used because client-side authentication is trivial to bypass.

==How to Check==

To verify that authentication is implemented on the server-side:

# **Review authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication controls as pertaining to your application:
#* Enforcing password strength requirements.
#* Allowing secure password reset or recovery.
#* Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.
#* Using multi-factor authentication.
#* Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.
#* Using SSL/TLS to secure communications.
#* Throttling repeated authentication attempts.
#* Locking inactive authentication accounts.
# **Identify authentication code.** Identify the code that is responsible for authentication both on the iOS device and on the remote server.
# **Review authentication code.** Examine authentication code to find where the actual security controls are implemented.
# **Verify that authentication is implemented on the server.** Make sure that sufficient security controls to satisfy authentication requirements are implemented on the server-side.


==How to Fix==

To implement authentication on the server-side:

# **Define authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication controls as pertaining to your application:
#* Enforcing password strength requirements.
#* Allowing secure password reset or recovery.
#* Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.
#* Using multi-factor authentication.
#* Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.
#* Using SSL/TLS to secure communications.
#* Throttling repeated authentication attempts.
#* Locking inactive authentication accounts.
# **Implement authentication on the server.** It is important to implement security controls, such as authentication on the server, because client-side security controls can be tampered with or disabled altogether on the client. Implement authentication controls that match the requirements defined in the previous step on the server back-end. 
# **Add client-side code that authenticates to the server.** Once authentication is implemented in accordance with the requirements, add client-side code that authenticates to the server. The client-side code will need an interface for managing authentication credentials, network code that communicates with the server using SSL/TLS, a token or some other means to maintain a session state on the server, and possibly secure storage for cached authentication credentials.

==Why==

Using Automatic Reference Counting prevents use-after-free vulnerabilities.

==How to Check==

To verify that Automatic Reference Counting(ARC) is used:

# **Identify the SDK version.** Automatic Reference Counting is only available in iOS SDK versions 5.0 and higher. If the SDK version is lower than that, then ARC is not being used.
# **Check XCode settings.** Examine XCode compiler options. Make sure that //Objective-C Automatic Reference Counting// is set to //yes//.
# **(Optional) Examine the binary.** Use the //otool// command to detect if ARC symbols are present in a binary, like so:\\{{{ otool -I -v BinaryFile }}}\\
Examine the output of the //otool// command. The presence of at least some of the following symbols means that ARC is being used by the binary:
#* //_objc_release
#* //_obc_retain
#* //_objc_storeStrong
#* //_objc_retainAutoreleaseReturnValue
#* //_objc_autoreleaseReturnValue//\\

==How to Fix==

To enable Automatic Reference Counting(ARC):

# **Use a compatible SDK.** Use iOS SDK 5.0 or higher to be able to use Automatic Reference Counting.
# **Launch XCode.** Open the XCode environment.
# **Enable Automatic Reference Counting.** Set the compiler option //Objective-C Automatic Reference Counting// to //yes//.

#* Plists
#* Keychain
# **Define encryption requirements for sensitive data that is stored in files.** Choose the level of protection that is the most appropriate for each type of sensitive data handled by the application that is stored in files. The iOS Data Protection API provides the following protection levels:
#* //FileProtectionNone// - no encryption.
#* //FileProtectionComplete// - encrypt the file and deny access when the device is locked.
#* //FileProtectionCompleteUnlessOpen// - encrypt the file until it is open, leave it decrypted while it is open even if the device is locked.
#* //FileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication// - encrypt the file until the device is unlocked for the first time after a reboot.
# **Define encryption requirements for sensitive data that is stored in the keychain.** Choose the level of protection that is the most appropriate for each type of sensitive data handled by the application that is stored in the keychain. The keychain provides the following protection levels:
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleAlways// - the item is always available.
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked// - the item is only available when the device is unlocked.
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock// - the item is only available after the device is unlocked for the first time after a reboot.
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleAlwaysThisDeviceOnly// - the item is always available, but is not moved to other devices.
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly// - the item is only available when the device is unlocked and is not moved to other devices.
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly// - the item is only available after the device is unlocked for the first time after a reboot and is not moved to other devices.
# **Encrypt sensitive files.** Use the appropriate APIs to encrypt stored sensitive data. Data stored in the keychain is always encrypted.

      <Data><![CDATA[==What to Do==

Implement code integrity checks that are difficult to bypass.

==Why==

Code integrity checks help prevent software piracy and unauthorized modifications to the application. Code integrity checks do not provide 100% assurance of code integrity. Code integrity checks make it harder for an attacker to modify the application binary code without breaking it.

==How==

To check code for integrity:

# **Write piracy check functions.** One common way to check if the application is not licensed properly is to check if the device is jailbroken. While a jailbroken device does not necessarily mean the application has been pirated, there are no fool-proof anti-piracy or code integrity measures for jailbroken devices. Some common ways to check for jailbroken devices are to check for the existence of files that only appear on jailbroken devices, such as Cydia. If piracy is not a concern, this step may be omitted.
# **Write integrity check functions.** The most common ways for implementing code integrity checks are by checking classes for expected addresses or checksums. The //class_getMethodImplementation// method returns a pointer a method; checking the value of this pointer against the expected value provides reasonable assurance that the method has not been modified during runtime.
# **Define integrity check functions as inline.** The integrity check functions written in the previous step should be defined as //inline// so that the compiler inserts the full integrity checking code wherever it is invoked.
# **Scatter integrity check functions throughout the application.** Multiple integrity checking functions spread out throughout the application make it harder for an attacker to find them all and patch them.

Do not log sensitive data.

==Why==

If sensitive data is logged, it may be recovered by an attacker if the device is lost or compromised.

==How==

To prevent logging of sensitive data:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of types of sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:
#* Passwords
#* Encryption keys
#* Personal information
# **Review logging code.** Identify code that generates log entries by searching for //NSLog()// function calls. Review this code to verify that it does not include sensitive information in log entries. If necessary, rewrite this code in a way that does not log sensitive data. If //NSLog()// calls are necessary for debugging, they can be conditionally commented out using //#define// directives.

* Jailbroken iDevices.

==What to Do==

Change root passwords on jailbroken devices.

==Why==

Changing the root password prevents unauthorized parties from being able to connect to the device remotely via SSH using the default authentication credentials. The default root password in iOS is "alpine". Jailbroken devices often run SSH by default and allow root users to login. If the default root password is not changed, attackers may be able to access the device remotely with super-user privileges and manage files or execute commands.

==How==

There are multiple ways for changing the root passwords on jailbroken devices, but they usually require a command line interface. One common approach is to use the MobileTerminal program, which is available from Cydia. MobileTerminal is not installed by default, however. SSH is usually installed by default and enabled on jailbroken devices. To use SSH to change the root password on a jailbroken device:

# **Identify the IP of the jailbroken device.** There are many different ways to identify the IP of a jailbroken device. One of the simplest ways is to connect the device to a WiFi network and check its IP from the Settings application. After the device is connected to a WiFi network, go to //Settings -> Wi-Fi -> [name of your network here]// and you will see the IP Address assigned to the device.
# **SSH into the jailbroken device.** Use your SSH client of choice to connect to the iDevice using the IP identified in the earlier step. The username is //root//. The password is //alpine//.
# **Change the root password.** Issue the following command to change the root password: {{{passwd}}}. You will be asked to enter the new password twice.

Validate data passed to //UIWebView// controls.

==Why==

Validating data passed to //UIWebView// controls helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. //UIWebView// controls are capable of executing JavaScript passed to them. If unvalidated data is passed to //UIWebView// controls, it may be possible for an attacker to pass malicious JavaScript, which will then be executed in the context of the application.

==How==

To validate data passed to //UIWebView// controls:

# **Identify data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Examine the application design and identify what types of data are handled by //UIWebView// controls, if any.
# **Identify code that passes data to //UIWebView// controls.** Review code to identify all //UIWebView// controls used by the application and code that passes data that may include JavaScript to them. Trouble areas may be found by searching for //stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString// method calls.
# **Write validation code for data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Add data validation methods to the application that validate all data types sent to //UIWebView// controls used by the application. Pay particular attention to any data that may include JavaScript.
# **Write encoding code for data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Write encoding routines that handle all the types of data that are passed to //UIWebView// controls. Unfortunately, there appear to be no standard libraries that handle encoding for iOS. Things to watch out for are: converting data to the same character-encoding before validating or encoding, escaping HTML entities, escaping JavaScript entities, and escaping XML entities, depending on context.
# **Validate and encode data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Use the respective validation and encoding functions for each respective type of data before passing it to //UIWebView// controls.

Store sensitive data such as encryption keys and cached authentication credentials in the //keychain//.

==Why==

Authentication credentials and encryption keys should be stored in the //keychain//, because the //keychain// encrypts data that is stored in it and is designed for storing such information. The //keychain// is also suitable for storing application configuration settings.

==How==

To use the //keychain// to store cached authentication data and encryption keys:

# **Identify cached authentication data.** Make a list of types of cached authentication data used by your application. Some examples are:
#* Passwords
#* Certificates
#* Encryption keys
#* Authentication tokens
# **Define encryption requirements for sensitive data that is stored in files.** Choose the level of protection that is the most appropriate for each type of sensitive data handled by the application that is stored in files. The iOS Data Protection API provides the following protection levels:
#* //FileProtectionNone// - no encryption.
#* //FileProtectionComplete// - encrypt the file and deny access when the device is locked.
#* //FileProtectionCompleteUnlessOpen// - encrypt the file until it is open, leave it decrypted while it is open even if the device is locked.
#* //FileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication// - encrypt the file until the device is unlocked for the first time after a reboot.
# **Define encryption requirements for sensitive data that is stored in the keychain.** Choose the level of protection that is the most appropriate for each type of sensitive data handled by the application that is stored in the keychain. The keychain provides the following protection levels:
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleAlways// - the item is always available.

#* //kSecAttrAccessibleAlwaysThisDeviceOnly// - the item is always available, but is not moved to other devices.
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly// - the item is only available when the device is unlocked and is not moved to other devices.
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly// - the item is only available after the device is unlocked for the first time after a reboot and is not moved to other devices.
# **Identify the code that caches authenticaton data.** Review the application code to find all code that handles data that should be stored in the //keychain//.
# **Store cached authentication credentials in the keychain.** Add code that uses the //keychain// to store cached authentication data to all code that handles such data or rewrite existing code as necessary.

Sign application updates.

==Why==

Application updates should be signed to verify that they came from a trusted source. In practice, updates to iOS applications are distributed as full new versions rather than patches. iOS application updates have to be signed to run, just like entirely new applications have to be signed.

* iOS applications that open saved files or documents.

==What to Do==

Verify that the format of the file is correct when opening saved files or documents.

==Why==

Many vulnerabilities are exploited via malformed documents supplied to the application. One particular vector of attack that is frequently used is embedding malformed documents in web pages - some applications are integrated into the web browser and will open malicious documents automatically in that scenario. Making sure that file format is valid before loading files into the application makes it harder to embed exploit code into documents.

==How==

Perform the following actions to validate file format before loading files into the application:

# **Define file format.** Specify valid values for all possible fields in all document types used by your applications. This information should be a part of project documentation and the developers may already have it.
# **Review code.** Search for code that loads saved files into the application. Examine the extents of the validation already being performed by the application. If some validation is already being performed, some code may be recycled for a more thorough validation routine.
# **Implement validation.** Write validation functions for all fields in all document types supported by the application.
# **Centralize validation.** Move the validation functions for all document fields to the centralized input and data validation class or library. Write a master file format validation function that calls all individual data field validation functions.
# **Use validation.** Go back to code that loads data files into the application. Remove any old validation code. Add code that calls the master file format validation function on all files being loaded before loading them into the application.

Disable parsing of external XML entities.

==Why==

Parsing external entities in XML documents may result in injection vulnerabilities.

==How==

There are two common ways to parse XML in iOS: //NSXMLParser// and //LibXML2//. 

# **NSXMLParser.** Parsing of external entities is disabled by default in //NSXMLParser//. Don't explicitly enable parsing of external entities - avoid using the //setShouldResolveExternalEntities// option. 
# **LibXML2**. Parsing of external entitites needs to be manually disabled in //LibXML2//. To disable parsing of external entities, use the //xmlSetExternalEntityLoader// method of the //parser// class to set the external entity loader to be a function that doesn't do anything.

Validate all user input by using white-list/positive input validation. White-list input validation means allowing only input that is explicitly defined as valid, as opposed to black-list input validation, which filters out known bad input.

==Why==

Properly implemented input validation is effective at preventing many types of injection vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting and SQL injection.

==How==

To validate all user input using white-list input validation:

# **Identify all entry points for user input.** Make a list of all possible sources of user input in your application.
# **Identify all types on input accepted by the application.** For each source of user input on the list, define valid characters, length, format, and range (for numerical values).
# **Define an input validation subsystem.** Define a set of validator functions that should be used to validate each type of input handled by the application. Input should be validated on the server.
# **Validate characters.** Restrict the acceptable range of characters in text input by using regular expressions.
# **Validate length.** Add code to check that the length of the user input is valid.
# **Validate format.** If the input type has a specific pattern, such as a date or a phone number, add code to use regular expressions to make sure user input matches the input type specified by the application. Use regular expressions to enforce strong password requirements.
# **Validate range.** Restrict the acceptable range of numerical input by comparing the input to the maximum and minimum acceptable values.
# **(Optional) Reject and respond to known bad input.** This step does not add much actual security, but it is included here to let you know that such an option exists. The input validation subsystem may check for known attack strings and respond to these likely attacks by alerting the user. The options for responding to invalid input are: reject invalid input, log invalid input, take evasive action.
# **(Optional) Encode input.** If the input is going to be displayed back through the web application, consider adding code to encode it to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

*iOS applications that access data stored in a SQL database.

==What to Do==

Use parameterized methods for database access.

==Why==

Use parameterized methods for database access to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

==How==

To use parameterized methods for local database access:

# **Identify the APIs used for SQL database access.** The most common library for SQL database access in iOS applications is SQLite.
# **Identify available parameterized SQL access APIs.** Research the APIs for executing queries provided by the API used in your application and choose ones that separate SQL commands and data. The dangerous APIs are the ones that accept SQL queries as strings - they should be avoided. For SQLite, the statements and the data must first be converted to UTF-8 or UTF-16 character encodings. In SQLite, the way to use parameterized queries is to use prepared statements and pass data as parameters. The //sqlite3_prepare//, //sqlite3_prepare_v2//, //sqlite3_prepare16//, and //sqlite3_prepare16_v2// functions allow creating prepared statements. After a statement is prepared, variables are bound to it using //sqlite3_bind_*// functions. After variables have been bound, the query is executed using the //sqlite3_step// function as many times as necessary to get the full resultant data set - each call to //sqlite3_step// produces one row. The query can be reset by using the //sqlite3_reset// function - this resets the query result pointer to zero, so that //sqlite3_step// would start from the first resultant row again. After database access is complete, the query and its result should be destroyed using the //sqlite3_finalize// function.
# **Identify code that executes SQL queries.** Examine application code to find code that executes SQL queries.
# **Use parameterized APIs to execute SQL queries.** Make sure that parameterized queries are used by code that executes SQL queries. Rewrite existing code if necessary or add code that uses parameterized queries to perform database access. 

There is no practical way to access remote SQL databases using native iOS API calls, so the most common way to access remote SQL databases from iOS applications is by writing a Web Service wrapper for the database server. To use parameterized methods for remote database access:

# **Set up a Web Service back-end server.** Choose a platform for deploying the Web Services back-end and configure the server appropriately. One of the most common solutions is to use an ASP.NET back-end, because ASP.NET is well suited for developing Web Services.
# **Write the Web Service code.** Implement the necessary Web Services on the platform of your choice.
# **Use parameterized APIs to execute SQL queries.** When implementing the Web Services, make sure to use parameterized APIs for database access to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
# **Connect the application to the back-end.** Add code to the iOS application to interact with the back-end. It might be necessary to add some pages for configuring the connection to the back-end, such as setting the URL of the Web Services and the authentication credentials.

Validate and encode data inserted into XML documents.

==Why==

Validating and encoding data inserted into XML documents helps prevent XML injection vulnerabilities.

==How==

To validate and encode data inserted into XML documents:

# **Identify XML documents used by the application.** Examine the application design to identify all XML documents and XML document types used by the application.
# **Identify code that uses XML documents.** Review application code to find code that uses XML documents.
# **Add data validation code.** Add methods that validate all the data types that are stored in XML documents and used by the application.
# **Use validation code.** Add code that uses the data validation methods from the previous step to code that uses XML documents. Validation should be performed before encoding.
# **Add encoding code.** Add methods that escape XML entities. Unfortunately, there are no stable libraries available for escaping XML entities for iOS. When writing code that escapes XML entities, consider the following: data has to be converted to a uniform character encoding first, XML entities have to be escaped properly, and code that loads XML documents should be able to restore the original data from the encoded data.
# **Use encoding code.** Add code that encodes data to code that uses XML documents.

* iOS applications where Obj-C code passes file names and paths to C code.

==What to Do==

Check //NSString// objects that are used for file names or paths to make sure they don't contain null bytes.

==Why==

Checking file names and paths for null bytes helps prevent unauthorized file access. Code written in C uses null bytes to terminate strings. If a string containing null bytes is passed to C code, the C code will only usually see the part until the first null byte. Attackers often use this quality to be able to access unintended files by inserting null bytes in file names. Objective-C //NSString// objects are not terminated by null bytes, so an attacker may use them to pass paths and names containing null bytes to native C code.

==How==

To check file paths and names for null bytes:
# **Identify all input used for file access.** Enumerate all file access performed by the application. Examine code responsible for accessing each file. Take note of any input used to form path or file names for file access.
# **Remove null bytes from paths.** If a //NSString// object contains a file name or path and includes a null byte, an incorrect resource may be accessed. Verify that there are no null bytes in strings that are used for file names or paths. If null bytes are detected, it is safer to abort the operation than to strip the null bytes, because the presence of null bytes almost certainly indicates an attack.

* iOS applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Do==

Use server-side authentication.

==Why==

Server-side authentication should be used because client-side authentication is trivial to bypass.

==How==

To use server-side authentication:

# **Define authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication controls as pertaining to your application:
#* Enforcing password strength requirements.
#* Allowing secure password reset or recovery.
#* Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.
#* Using multi-factor authentication.
#* Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.
#* Using SSL/TLS to secure communications.
#* Throttling repeated authentication attempts.
#* Locking inactive authentication accounts.
# **Implement authentication on the server.** It is important to implement security controls, such as authentication on the server, because client-side security controls can be tampered with or disabled altogether on the client. Implement authentication controls that match the requirements defined in the previous step on the server back-end. 
# **Add client-side code that authenticates to the server.** Once authentication is implemented in accordance with the requirements, add client-side code that authenticates to the server. The client-side code will need an interface for managing authentication credentials, network code that communicates with the server using SSL/TLS, a token or some other means to maintain a session state on the server, and possibly secure storage for cached authentication credentials.

* iOS applications that send or receive sensitive data over the network.

==What to Do==

Use SSL to protect network communications.

==Why==

Properly using SSL to encrypt network communications prevents eavesdropping attacks. Other types of Man-in-the-middle attacks may also be prevented by using SSL.

==How==

To use SSL to protect communications:

# **Identify all communications performed by the application.** Review the application design to identify all network communications that are performed by the application.
# **Define communication security requirements.** Define which network communications need to be encrypted. All transmissions that include sensitive data should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.
# **Identify code that uses the network.** Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.
# **Add code that uses SSL.** Add code that uses SSL to code that performs network communications that need to be encrypted. The //NSURLRequest// and //NSURLConnection// classes support SSL with an acceptably secure default configuration starting with iOS 5 - this is the most practical way to use SSL on iOS and should be sufficient for most applications.

*iOS applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Do==

Throttle authentication attempts by making authentication code pause for a few seconds between each authentication request per IP.

==Why==

Throttle authentication attempts to make password guessing attacks less effective. Authentication throttling should be implemented on the server to be effective.

==How==

To throttle authentication attempts:

# **Define authentication throttling requirements.** Define the time-out period between each authentication attempt. A recommended time-out period is three seconds.
# **Identify authentication code.** Identify server-side code that is responsible for authentication.
# **Add code that throttles authentication attempts.** Add server-side code to the authentication code identified in the previous step to wait for the required time period before handling another authentication request. Keep track of clients using IPs and session cookies to make it harder to bypass authentication throttling.

* iOS applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Do==

Implement a secure password reset function.

==Why==

Password reset and recovery features are important to prevent locking out of users that forgot their passwords, however they also present a security challenge. An attacker might try to compromise user passwords by abusing the password recovery or reset functions and these functions by definition need to be accessible to unauthenticated users, so they require particular diligence in being protected. Password reset is preferable to recovery - if an attacker manages to change the user's password, the user should be able to notice that a compromise has taken place.

==How==

To implement a secure password reset function:

# **Implement password resetting on the server.** Most of the password resetting functionality should be implemented on the server. The iOS application might need a button on the login page for requesting a password reset.
# **Verify user identity.** The exact method for verifying user identity should be specific to the application and  based on the types of information available about the user and the security requirements. User identity is often established by asking security questions that are associated with the account and proceeding with the reset only if the correct answer is provided. At the very least, the application should ask for the e-mail address associated with the user account for which the password reset is requested.
# **Use a side channel to send a password reset token.** The most common and effective solution is to send a difficult to predict token to the e-mail address associated with the user account for which the password reset is requested.
# **Provide a control for changing the password.** Once the user has the password reset token, there should be a way for the user to submit that token and to then be able to change the password. One way is to provide a web page that does this, another is to provide a Web Service to the iOS application that accepts the password reset token and allows the user to change the password; both methods may be used in combination.
# **Log the password reset event.** Both failed and successful password reset requests should be logged on the server. A large amount of password reset requests may indicate an attack.

* iOS applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Do==

Encrypt authentication credentials sent over the network. Using SSL is the simplest way to protect the authentication process.

==Why==

Encrypting authentication credentials sent over the network helps prevent various man-in-the-middle attacks, such as spoofing or hijacking.

==How==

To encrypt authentication credentials sent over the network:

# **Identify the authentication mechanism used by the application.** Most applications use usernames and passwords for authentication, however there are other options available, such as certificates. 
# **Identify the authentication code.** Identify the code that is responsible for authentication both on the iOS device and on the remote server. The authentication itself should be implemented on the server. To protect authentication credentials in transit, both end points need to support SSL. 
# **Encrypt authentication credentials in transit.** Add code that uses SSL to protect authentication credentials in transit. The server should be configured to only accept authentication credentials via SSL. The iOS //NSURLRequest// and //NSURLConnection// classes support SSL and should be sufficient for many common authentication scenarios.

#* //NSLog//
#* //stringWithFormat//
#* //stringByAppendingFormat//

#* //vwfprintf//
#* //fwscanf//
#* //wscanf//
#* //swscanf//
# **Avoid using formatted functions.** Consider replacing formatted input-output functions with other functions, which are not prone to format string vulnerabilities.
# **(Re-)Write code to exclude user input from format strings.** Place user input in separate variables and pass it as variadic arguments to the formatted input-output functions, instead of placing it in a format strings.

Disable file sharing in applications that offer file sharing when file sharing is not being used.

==Why==

Disable file sharing to prevent unauthorized access. Some applications share all the user's files by default. If file sharing is necessary, it should only be enabled when it is being used.

==How==

To disable file sharing in applications that support it:

# **Identify applications with file sharing capabilities.** Enumerate all the installed applications. Check each application to see if it supports file sharing.
# **Disable or secure file sharing.** Disable file sharing for each application that enables such functionality when file sharing is not being used. If the application offers security features to protect file sharing, such as password protection, use these features to protect file sharing. Even if security features are available for file sharing, file sharing should be disabled when it is not being used.
# **Disable file sharing by default.** When developing applications, disable file sharing by default in your applications.

* iOS applications that send or receive sensitive data over the network.

==What to Do==

Use strong SSL configurations for protecting network traffic.

==Why==

Using strong SSL configurations prevents eavesdropping and other man-in-the-middle attacks. iOS SSL configurations are relatively strong by default, depending on the SDK version, and need to be intentionally degraded to be unsafe. Unfortunately, many developers degrade iOS SSL strength for compatibility with the development environments and subsequently do not restore the SSL configuration to the secure defaults in the production releases.

==How==

To use strong SSL configurations:

# **Disable self-signed certificates.** Self-signed certificates are disabled by default by the iOS SDK. Developers have to intentionally enable self-signed certificates for them to be acceptable by the application. Self-signed certificates are often enabled for testing in the development environment. It is important to disable self-signed certificates in production releases, because self-signed certificates allow man-in-the-middle attacks, which largely negate the use of SSL.
# **Identify the available SDK version.** Identify the iOS SDK version used by the application.
# **Use strong cypher suites.** The cypher suites used by SSL implementations in iOS SDKs vary by version. Versions 5 and higher of the iOS SDK may be considered to use strong SSL cypher suites. There are no practical ways to control which cypher suites are used by iOS applications. If strength of SSL cyphers is a critical requirement, use version 5 or higher of the iOS SDK.

*iOS applications that access resources on a remote server.

==What to Do==

Enumerate the different types of users and create specific roles for them. When authorizing access to a resource, build the security checks on a per-role basis rather than on a per-user basis.

==Why==

Application roles allow administrators to group users into categories that need the same level of privileges. The mechanism provides an easy and clear way to discover and manage the least privileges necessary for the execution of a given task. It provides a more robust and flexible way of managing the application's users.

==How==

Use the following steps when designing role-based security:

# **Understand the different types of users.** Enumerate the different types of users needed for the application. Understand how they will use the application and to which resources they will need access. Create a matrix mapping the actions each role is authorized to perform with the corresponding system components. Use this matrix to identify the different types of users according to the functionality they need. Creating a threat model may be a useful step to ensure that you correctly understand the implications of this matrix.
# **Establish the roles.** Define which resources can be accessed by each role. There are two approaches when enforcing role-based security - programmatic and declarative.
#* **The programmatic approach.** The programmatic approach to role-based security is written inside the code and provides additional runtime flexibility. It allows your application to dynamically create and assign roles so that user privileges can be granted and revoked without the need of restarting your application. When using the programmatic approach to role-based security, place access control checks at the appropriate locations in your application.
#* **The declarative approach.** The declarative approach to role-based security is done via the configuration files. It allows easy manageability as the declarations can be modified without having to recompile. By using the declarative approach, you can easily manage the security settings for large portions of the application without changing the source code.
# **Manage the users.** Assign the users into their respective user roles. The application should enforce the security policy according to the user roles instead of the actual user.

Avoid using URL handlers for sensitive operations.

==Why==

URL handlers may be abused in Cross-Site Scripting attacks. If URL handlers are used for sensitive operations, such sensitive operations may be exploited in Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

==How==

To avoid using URL handlers for sensitive operations:

# **Identify all URL handlers used by the application.** Examine the application .plist file for //URL Types// defined by the application. These //URL Types// correspond to URL handlers used by the application.
# **Identify the operations associated with the URL handlers.** The developers should know what each //URL Type// is responsible for. Consider each one and decide if it is safe to keep.
# **Remove dangerous URL handlers.** Sometimes URL handlers are used for testing. Remove any URL handlers that may be too dangerous from the production release.
# **Verify the origin of the URL request**. Use the //openURL// method to make sure the URL request came from within the application itself or from a trusted application for any remaining URL handlers.

==Dangerous API Guidelines==

      <Data><![CDATA[==What to Do==

Canonizalize and validate all file paths that include input data. Use the //stringByStandardizingPath// function to canonicalize file paths before validating them.

==Why==

Canonicalizing file paths before validating them helps prevent unauthorized access. If a file path is not canonicalized, an attacker may use special characters to access resources outside of what is allowed by the application.

==How==

To canonicalize file names and paths:

# **Identify all input used for file access.** Enumerate all file access performed by the application. Examine code responsible for accessing each file. Take note of any input used to form path or file names for file access.
# **Remove null bytes from paths.** If a file name or path includes a null byte, an incorrect resource may be accessed. Verify that there are no null bytes in strings that are used for file names or paths. If null bytes are detected, it is safer to abort the operation than to strip the null bytes, because the presence of null bytes almost certainly indicates an attack.
# **Canonicalize all input data used for file access.** The exact approach for canonicalization is different for different applications. One common scenario is appending a user-specified file name to a predefined path. In that case, the //lastPathComponent// method of the //NSString// class should be used on the file name to get just the file name. After that, the file name should be added to the predefined path.
# **Validate file paths.** Verify that the user or application are authorized to access the specified resource.

Write code in a way that guarantees that pointers are not used after memory that they point to has been deallocated.

==Why==

Accessing memory that has been deallocated may result in an exploitable vulnerability. This type of vulnerability is called a "dangling pointer vulnerability". The unallocated memory is accessed via a pointer that has been used to free the memory earlier - this pointer is the "dangling pointer".

==How==

Write code in such a way that guarantees that pointers are not used after memory that they point to has been deallocated. One way to do this is to deallocate memory at the end of functions, so that there is no code that accesses memory after it has been deallocated. Perform the following actions to assure that unallocated memory is not accessed:

# **Search for deallocation code.** Review code to find all places where memory is being deallocated.
# **Move deallocation code.** Place deallocation code right before exit points of the function. Set pointers to null. Make sure that deallocated pointers are not being used elsewhere in the application.

Sign application binaries for distribution.

==Why==

Cryptographically signing applications assures that the application binary has not been tampered with and that it came from a trusted source. Applications have to be signed with a trusted certificate to run on iOS.

==How==

The iOS application signing process is complicated, but it is also well documented by Apple. To sign iOS applications:

# **Prepare the application for the release.** Build the application in release mode. Remove or disable any development settings or code from the application. Disable support for self-signed SSL certificates if it has been enabled. Disable generation of log entries that were used for debugging. Disable file sharing by default if the application supports it. Make sure the default application settings are secure. Make sure the application does not use any private iOS APIs.
# **Create a distribution provisioning profile.** You have to be a member of the iOS Developer Program to publish iOS applications. Once you have an account, you can go to the iOS Dev Center and submit requests for provisioning profiles. Download the new distribution profile.
# **Install the distribution provisioning profile.** Double-click the downloaded distribution profile and it should be added to Xcode.
# **Create an application archive.** Build your application and create the .ipa file. Make sure that Xcode is configured to build the application in release mode and using the correct distribution profile.
# **Examine the application record in iTunes Connect.** Go to iTunes connect and fill out the forms to create the application record, if necessary.
# **Submit the application for publication.** Go to //Product//, //Archive// in XCode and follow on-screen instructions to submit the application for approval.
# **Wait for approval notification.** The e-mail account associated with the iOS Developer Program account should receive a notification regarding the status of the approval process. This might take a week or more, but after it is finished, the application should be signed and ready for distribution.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to inject arbitrary client-side code into the user's browser. XSS attacks target the application's users and not the application itself, but they use the application as the vehicle for the attack.

There are two primary types of XSS, persistent and non-persistent. If the attacker is able to inject his malicious script into the web applications data store, then the script will be persistent and anyone who loads a page with that content will run the script and become a victim of the attack. Forums and other web services that have user supplied HTML content are a classic example of this. If this content is not validated and encoded then anyone can leave a malicious script on the site. Non-Persistent XSS uses some reflective aspect of the page to deliver the payload. Web applications often echo user input back to them without altering it. Attackers can create and distribute URLs for such sites that contain malicious scripts that gets reflected back to the users. One of the most common examples of this is the "page not found" error page which echoes the requested URL back to the user.

Exception Information Disclosure is a type of vulnerabilities where the application discloses information that somehow gives an advantage to the attacker as a result of an error. Attackers can use application error information to improve their ability to attack the application.

Almost all methods calls in computer programs, provide some feedback to the calling method about the status of the operation. This feedback could be a function return value, an exception which was thrown by the called method, or an error string. Based on this feedback, an applications decides if it should tell the user about a significant result (usually success or failure). When an error occurs, some applications choose to echo the internal error messages to the user. Though this feature is helpful in debugging a problem, it could lead to an information disclosure issue. An attacker could use this technical information to gain a better understanding about the back-end processing of the product and craft more malicious attacks against it.

XPath injection is a type of vulnerabilities that allows attackers to execute arbitrary queries on XML databases. XPath injection most commonly occurs as a result of concatenating user input with query strings. XPath injection vulnerabilities are similar to SQL injection vulnerabilities, but target XML databases instead of SQL databases. XPath injection vulnerabilities are often more dangerous than SQL injection attacks, because permissions are not enforced and the malicious queries can access every part of the XML documents. XPath injection attacks may allow retrieving, manipulating, or destroying data stored in XML documents.

File canonicalization vulnerabilities are a type of vulnerabilities that allow attackers to access unauthorized resources by entering obscure file names or paths. The process of resolving different forms of input that refer to the same standard name (the canonical name) is called canonicalization. Code is particularly susceptible to canonicalization issues if it makes security decisions based on the name of a resource that is passed to the program as input. Files, paths, host names, and URLs are resource types that are vulnerable to canonicalization because in each case there are many different ways to represent the same name.

  <p>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Web Applications that use an AJAX implementation</li>
  </ul>
  <p />
  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) technology allows web pages to dynamically update specific content behind the scenes without the need to refresh the whole page. The ability to continually update the content of an AJAX page is done by calling an XmlHttpRequest
 (XHR) object with JavaScript to send HTTP requests to web servers. These requests typically send data in the form of XML or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
</p>
  <p>AJAX injection is a type of 
Cross Site Scripting Attack (XSS) that leverages the XML or JSON format of the input to the client browser. JSON is particularly popular because it is easy to parse JSON objects by simply passing them to the eval() function. Unfortunately, the use of eval()
 makes the application equivalently easy to exploit. Cleverly formatted strings containing malicious JavaScript may be stored as content on servers with weak validation or sent directly to the client browser using a spoofing or man in the middle attack. This JavaScript
 is then parsed and execute by the client's browser without their knowledge. Ultimately, this attack may be used to steal session cookies, send email on behalf of the victim.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Since the code runs in the same domain as the trusted site any cookies or other confidential site data can be read by the malicious AJAX code.
</li>
    <li>
      <strong>JavaScript code injection:</strong> By using the XMLHttpRequest object attackers can download and install JavaScript code modules to be run on the local browser dynamically and send information from the computer to the attacker without the victim's knowledge.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Failure to validate user input for script tags when that input is echoed back into a web page.&amp;nbsp;
</li>
    <li>Failure to encode user supplied input upon display of the data</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Constrain input:</strong> Use vigorous white-list style checking on any user input that may be reflected to a user's browser.
</p>
  <p>
    <strong>HTMLEncode all user input on display:</strong> Use white-list style HTMLEncoding libraries to ensure all possibly malicious characters are encoded before being echoed back to the user, regardless of whether they're loaded as part of the original
 page load or through later XMLHttpRequests.</p>
  <h1>Example</h1>
  <p>Suppose you use an AJAX based web mail client. Because these are the days of Web 2.0, your mail client displays a list of your favorite contacts and lets you know their status. By default this status is set to "Online" or "Away," but a custom message may also be set by each contact that is reflected in your client. In order for this to work, the web page periodically updates this status list by requesting the list of contacts from the server. The server returns this information to the client as the following
 JSON object:</p>
  <pre>{<br />   "numberOnline": "3",<br />   "nameAndStatus": [<br />   "Alice, Online",<br />   "Bob, Online",<br />   "Mallory, Away" ]<br />}</pre>
  <p>The following code shows the client JavaScript code which is called periodically to request the above object and update the DOM.</p>
  <pre>var contactStatusList;<br />var http_request = new XMLHttpRequest();<br />http_request.open("GET", url, true);<br />http_request.onreadystatechange = function ()<br /> {<br />    if (http_request.readyState == 4)<br /> {<br />        if (http_request.status == 200)<br /> {<br />            contactStatusList = eval("(" + http_request.responseText + ")");<br />        }        http_request = null;    }};http_request.send(null);</pre>
  <p>Now suppose that Mallory's status is set to a custom value. This may have been changed by Mallory herself or by a third party attacker. Either way, because the server providing the data to the mail client has poor validation, this status value is changed
 to include cleverly formatted malicious JavaScript. Suppose that instead of "Away" the value is changed to the following:</p>
  <pre>Away" ]};alert("Gotcha!");//</pre>
  <p>The first thing to notice is that the JSON object, which represents a the contact status list, is valid JavaScript. Because of this the eval() can be used to evaluate it. The above code completes the status object, inserts additional JavaScript, and comments
 out the rest of the line. When the code is passed as to the eval() function the additional JavaScript is run. Note that "alert("Gotcha!")" can be replaced with any malicious JavaScript and it will be run in the client's browser. Because the above code is an
 example, an alert message window will be displayed. In general, however, JavaScript could be downloaded and executed without the user's knowledge.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>All applications which use user input to construct the file name or path before accessing a file resource.</li>
  </ul>
  <p />
  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>If user input is used to construct a filename or path it is possible for that input to be format so that an unintended or protected file is read, modified, or executed instead. This is commonly accomplished by exploiting canonicalization issues or alternate data streams. Command injection may also be possible and would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.

  </ul>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Lack of or improper validation of user supplied input.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Use proper file permissions to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive files. </li>
    <li>If granular file permissions is not an option, then resolve file names and paths completely and verify them for access. </li>
    <li>Avoid the problem by designing software that does not need user input for filenames. One simple solution is to generate unique random filenames and use a dictionary to associate them with a user supplied label.</li>

    <li>Local applications that deal with secret data such as passwords, encryption keys, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p />
  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Attackers often scan the memory space of a locally running application if they need to find certain secrets that the application contains. This is because developers are usually lax when dealing with sensitive data securely when the data is inside the application's own memory space.</p>
  <p>It is common knowledge that in most modern operating systems, an application's memory space is protected and is not accessible by other applications on the same system. However, reading and modifying another application's memory is also essential for debuggers to work. For this purpose, operating systems contain workarounds to accomodate reading and writing to another application's memory. This allows any application on the system to debug another process and read its memory content. Although operating systems do require the debugger process to have special permissions in order to debug another application, this still remains a problem in situations where users have administrative privileges on their local machines.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Storing clear-text sensitive information in memory. </li>
    <li>Using obfuscation techniques instead of stronger protection mechanisms for sensitive information in memory.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Encrypt secret data</strong>: When sensitive data is present in application memory, it should be encrypted and the clear-text data should be overwritten as soon as possible. Freeing a variable does not clear the data it holds from memory; therefore it is important to remember to explicitly overwrite the memory segment where sensitive information was stored. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Store sensitive data in mutable objects</strong>: Mutable objects allow the data in them to be overwritten. This is especially useful in managed languages as objects are required to be deallocated through the garbage collector. Therefore there is no certainty when the sensitive data will be deallocated from the current process space. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Clear all sensitive data instances</strong>: Make sure that all memory locations, where sensitive data has been stored, are cleared/overwritten after their use. Losing a pointer to a sensitive data instance can result in not cleaning that particular memory and allowing the sensitive data to leak.</li>

  <p>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any application that interacts with a SQL database.</li>
  </ul>
  <p />
  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>A SQL injection attack exploits vulnerabilities in input validation to run arbitrary commands in the database. It can occur when your application uses input to construct dynamic SQL statements to access the database. It can also occur if your code uses stored procedures that are passed strings that contain raw user input. Using the SQL injection attack, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands in your database, with all the privileges granted to the process being attacked. The issue is magnified if the application uses an over-privileged account to connect to the database. In this instance it is possible to use the database server to run operating system commands and potentially compromise other servers, in addition to being able to retrieve, manipulate, and destroy data. </p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Since SQL databases generally hold sensitive data, loss of confidentiality is a frequent problem with SQL injection vulnerabilities. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Authentication</strong>: If poor SQL commands are used to check user names and passwords, it may be possible to connect to a system as another user with no previous knowledge of the password. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Authorization</strong>: If authorization information is held in an SQL database, it may be possible to change this information through the successful exploitation of an SQL injection vulnerability. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Integrity</strong>: Just as it may be possible to read sensitive information, it is also possible to make changes or even delete this information with an SQL injection attack. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The capabilities of an attacker are constrained by the permissions of the account you use to connect to the database. For this reason, your application should connect to the database with an account that has the minimum necessary set of privileges. </p>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Weak input validation. </li>
    <li>Dynamic construction of SQL statements without the use of type-safe parameters. </li>
    <li>Use of over-privileged database logins. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Constrain input.</strong> Use vigorous white-list style checking and type checking on any user input that may be used in an SQL command. Rather than escape meta-characters, it is safest to avoid adding them to your white-list. Later use of data that has been entered in the database may neglect to escape meta-characters before use. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use Parameterized SQL statements and stored procedures. </strong>Parameterized SQL statements will process characters that have special meaning to SQL (like single quote) without negative security implications. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use escaping routines</strong>. If you cannot use parameters and must use dynamic SQL, use escaping routines to handle special characters that have meaning to the database. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use an account with limited permissions in the database</strong>. Ideally the account should only have execute permissions on the set of stored procedures that your application needs to use. It should have no direct table access.&amp;nbsp; </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Do not echo database errors</strong>. Catch exceptions on the server and return generic error messages to the client.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Example</h1>
  <p>While it is easier and more reliable to fix SQL injection by parameterization, it can be fixed without it. Suppose we have a PHP/MySQL application that has two tables: users and products. Each row in the USER table contains the users ID, name, password, credit card number, and address. Similarly, the product table has a column for the product ID, description, and price. The application contains a SQL Query that retrieves the description of a product given its ID.</p>
  <pre>$query = "SELECT description FROM products WHERE product_id = " + $prod_id + ";";$result = mysql_query($query);</pre>
  <p>So, if the value of $prod_id is 5 then $query reads:</p>
  <pre>SELECT description FROM products WHERE product_id = 5;</pre>
  <p>An attacker enters the following string where the application asks for the product ID (expecting a number):</p>
  <pre>5; SELECT * from users</pre>
  <p>Now $query has the following value which is a perfectly legitimate SQL query:</p>
  <pre>SELECT description FROM products WHERE product_id = 5; SELECT * from users;</pre>
  <p>The query is executed and the product description is returned along with every row in the User table and the attacker has all of the confidential information from the database.</p>

  <p />
  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>A keystore is a secure location on disk or in memory that can be used to store cryptographic keys or trusted certificates. Typically, these keys are bound to the machine and only available to a certain application. If the application uses a weak keystore, it may be possible to recover the keys and certificates from the keystore without proper credentials.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Information Disclosure:</strong> The attacker can gain access to the keys used by the application, allowing them to decrypt data the application attempts to protect with encryption, and to spoof the application to itself or other systems which trust data encrypted with those keys. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Elevation of Privilege:</strong> The attacker may also be able to add new keys to the keystore or modify existing ones. This can result in the application trusting keys controlled by the attacker for sensitive operations or communicating with other systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Using a Weak Keystore:</strong> Many operating environments provide a variety of key stores, some of which exist only for legacy reasons. Using an older version of a key store or a poorly implemented third party key store is likely to result in a key store compromise. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Improperly Configuring a Strong Keystore:</strong> Many keystores support a variety of configuration options which allow for a wide range of security choices. Understanding the properties of your key store is essential to using it securely. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Implementing a Custom or Homegrown Keystore:</strong> Strong keystores are both very tricky to write and require support from the operating environment. Attempting to write one should be considered on the same level as implementing a custom encryption algorithm or protocol, and should be avoided. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Poor Key Handling:</strong> If the application isn't careful with how it manages keys when it adds them to the store or reads them out from the store for use, both key compromise and key disclosure are possible, even if the key store itself is strong.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use a Strong Keystore:</strong> Which key store to use will vary by your platform. In Java, use the <strong>KeyStore</strong> class. On Windows, use DPAPI. Ensure that you are using the current version of the key store for your platform, including any patches.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Configure Your Keystore Correctly:</strong> Ensure that you know how to properly configure the key store in your environment. Ensure that any ACLs on the key store are locked down as tightly as possible while still allowing your system to function. For instance, after the initial install, it is unlikely that your application will need rights to add keys to the key store, nor rights to change the permissions on the key store; if possible, make sure the application gives these up after installation. Ensure that, if possible, all cryptographic operations occur within the scope of the protected keystore, instead of manually exporting keys from the store or reading the bits out; if you can do this and you can lock your key store down even further, ensure that these operations cannot be performed on the key store. If you have a choice of keys or algorithms used to protect keys in the key store, ensure that they are appropriately strong.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure Proper Key Handling:</strong> Handle your key material very carefully. Place keys in the key store as soon as possible and read them out as late as possible. Do not leave keys in memory when you do not need them, and ensure that the memory that you load them into is properly zeroed out. Be careful with immutable objects and garbage collection when handling key data. Under no circumstances should cleartext keys be written out to disk; among other things, make sure that you pin memory with sensitive data so that it will not be written out to swap.</p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any application that writes user input to an XML file on a server.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>An XML injection vulnerability will allow an attacker to insert malicious data into XML which resides on the server. Depending on the type of XML parser used (SAX or DOM), this malicious data could be used to either overwrite the values in previous nodes or cause the XML parser to consume an excessive amount of memory on the server.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Modification of previous node values in the XML </li>
    <li>Denial of Service on the server </li>
    <li>Exposure of entire XML document to unauthorized users. </li>
    <li>Addition of new nodes or even entire documents. </li>
    <li>Ability to modify or remove data that should not be accessed.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Dynamic XML generation using untrusted input </li>
    <li>Incorrectly defined schema </li>
    <li>Lack of schema validation </li>
    <li>Failure to validate input and properly encode any dangerous meta characters according to the context</li>
  </ul>
  <a name="Countermeasures">
  </a>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>When loading an XML file on the server validate it against a defined XSD</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Perform context-sensitive encoding of untrusted input</strong>. As with encoding data to be output in HTML, a whitelist approach should be taken. For each context which data is going to be inserted in (element, attribute value, etc.) a set of known-safe characters should be constructed. The data to be added should be checked against the whitelist, and any characters not specifically listed should be encoded. CDATA sections should be used to further ensure that the parser ignores special characters. Ideally, only non-XML values should be accepted from untrusted sources. If an XML blob must be accepted from an untrusted source, it should be manually reassembled from values parsed out and encoded after checking the received blob against an XSD.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Untrusted input should be validated against an inclusion list before use</strong>. For example, use a RegEx pattern, primitive type casting, a domain constraint, or another validator. See the Additional Resources for more information on data validation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Trim XML documents to include only the data that is necessary to the application</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use XML processing pipelines to make the flow of data clear and threats easier to identify</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Remove DOCTYPE element from user input before creating XML objects</strong>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Example</h1>
  <p>Let us assume that a valid node in our server side XML looks like this:</p>
  <pre>&lt;UserRecord&gt;   &lt;UniqueID&gt;5&lt;/UniqueID&gt;   &lt;Name&gt;Gandalf&lt;/Name&gt;   &lt;Email&gt;Gandalf@MiddleEarth.com&lt;/Email&gt;   &lt;Address&gt;One Middle Earth Way, ME&lt;/Address&gt;   &lt;ZipCode&gt;10000&lt;/ZipCode&gt;   &lt;PhoneNumber&gt;123-456-7890&lt;/PhoneNumber&gt;&lt;/UserRecord&gt;</pre>
  <p>The UniqueID field here is assigned by the server. Now, if web server accepts input from the user and stores it in the XML file, what is the outcome of the parser when a user enters the following data for the Email field:</p>
  <pre>Gandalf@MiddleEarth.com&lt;/Email&gt;&lt;UniqueID&gt;0&lt;/UniqueID&gt;&lt;Name&gt;Gandalf&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;Email&gt;Gandalf@MiddleEarth.com</pre>
  <p>The resulting XML on the server will look like this:</p>
  <pre>&lt;UserRecord&gt;   &lt;UniqueID&gt;5&lt;/UniqueID&gt;   &lt;Name&gt;Gandalf&lt;/Name&gt;   &lt;Email&gt;Gandalf@MiddleEarth.com&lt;/Email&gt;&lt;UniqueID&gt;0&lt;/UniqueID&gt;               &lt;Name&gt;Gandalf&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;Email&gt;Gandalf@MiddleEarth.com&lt;/Email&gt;   &lt;Address&gt;One Middle Earth Way, ME&lt;/Address&gt;   &lt;ZipCode&gt;10000&lt;/ZipCode&gt;   &lt;PhoneNumber&gt;123-456-7890&lt;/PhoneNumber&gt;&lt;/UserRecord&gt;</pre>
  <p>We now have two fields and values for UniqueID, Name and Email. The outcome of parsing such data will depend upon the type of XML parser used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If a SAX parser is used, it will report the UniqueID for this node to be 0, so an attacker would have essentially overwritten the field value. </li>
    <li>If a DOM parser is used, it will report an error. However, the DOM parser can be abused by inserting additional nodes in the XML while still matching the schema, which will lead to excessive memory consumption by the parser and could potentially result in a Denial of Service.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Also note that this is a simple example. It is possible to insert an entire new record among other issues. To fix the example above we can escape the markup delimiters to prevent the users input from being interpreted, replacing &amp; with &amp;, &lt; with &lt;, and so on as described in the Countermeasures section. This will prevent the users data from being interpreted in this case. In general, though, we don't know exactly what the input might look like, so the best plan is to have a white-list acceptable characters and do type checking as much as possible. Where type checking is not possible consider using CDATA to enforce that the string be treated strictly as data. For example:</p>
  <pre>$evil_input = "Gandalf@MiddleEarth.com&lt;/Email&gt;   &lt;UniqueID&gt;0&lt;/UniqueID&gt;&lt;Name&gt;Gandalf&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;Email&gt;Gandalf@MiddleEarth.com";$data = "&lt;![CDATA[" + $evil_input + "]]&gt;";</pre>
  <p>After we insert $data into the email field above the result will be the following acceptable XML:</p>
  <pre>&lt;UserRecord&gt;   &lt;UniqueID&gt;5&lt;/UniqueID&gt;   &lt;Name&gt;Gandalf&lt;/Name&gt;   &lt;Email&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Gandalf@MiddleEarth.com&lt;/Email&gt;&lt;UniqueID&gt;0&lt;/UniqueID&gt;             &lt;Name&gt;Gandalf&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;Email&gt;Gandalf@MiddleEarth.com]]&gt;   &lt;/Email&gt;   &lt;Address&gt;One Middle Earth Way, ME&lt;/Address&gt;   &lt;ZipCode&gt;10000&lt;/ZipCode&gt;   &lt;PhoneNumber&gt;123-456-7890&lt;/PhoneNumber&gt;&lt;/UserRecord&gt;</pre>
  <p>CDATA is very useful when used correctly but it has the same generic problem as we had before. An attacker can create a malicious string that uses "]]&gt;" to end the CDATA and insert malicious XML. Therefore, wherever we use CDATA we must also remove or escape ]]&gt; from the input string—at a certain point, it's easier to simply give up and encode everything by whitelist.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Applies To</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Any web application that requires a user to login to use a service.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Phishing is an attempt by an attacker to trick a legitimate user into entering personal information into an attacker's website. The attacker typically constructs a website that appears identical to a legitimate website but the data is posted to an illegitimate website. </p>
  <p>Most often, the attacker will send a mass e-mail to many users requesting them to update their information on the illegitimate website. The attacker may provide legitimate looking logos which have been harvested off the original website, or even text from past legitimate correspondences. The attacker will then provide a link to their malicious website, which has been setup to emulate every aspect of the valid site. The attacker may use a number of techniques to hide the true nature of the URL including URL redirection or known e-mail client or browser vulnerabilities. Once the victim browses to the malicious website and submits their information to the site the information is stored by the attacker and the user is redirected to the login site of the legitimate site. The malicious webpage may ask the user for any number of bits of sensitive information including: username, password, social security number, phone number, mother's maiden name, address, e-mail address, etc.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Confidentiality: </strong>This attack can be used by an attacker to obtain sensitive information about the victim user. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Authentication: </strong>The sensitive information (username, passwords) obtained using this attack can be used to log in as another user and access more information such as bank account details.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Web browsers failing to verify a website's security certificate. </li>
    <li>Lack of policy against request of such information. </li>
    <li>Failure to use modern anti-phishing techniques. </li>
    <li>Lack of education for users. </li>
    <li>Using multiple domains to host content within the same site, effectively priming users to ignore which domain they're currently talking to.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Implement and use SSL: </strong>Getting a certificate for use in SSL from a trusted Certificate Authority will help the user to verify the server is legitimate. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Create a policy:</strong> Publicly announce your company will never send a link in an e-mail to update information. Require your users to browse to your website manually. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use additional security measures: </strong>New anti-phishing mechanisms require a user to choose a personal image or theme. First, the user submits their username or a cookie (a form of loose identification), then the server responds by showing the user the image or theme they have chosen upon account creation, and finally, if the image or theme matches the theme the user remembers selecting, the user logs in completely. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Support only modern browsers: </strong>Most modern web browsers include basic anti-phishing mechanisms that will help your users verify the legitimacy of the website they are browsing. Encourage your users to upgrade to the latest version of their browser software. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use a single domain for all parts of an application:</strong> This way, if an attacker attempts to create a fake site to harvest user information, users will be primed to expect all pages to come from the same URL.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Example</h1>
  <p>Attacker's may use variations on the legitimate website address, such as: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Subdomains</strong>: http://www.abcbank.com.attack.com/ </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Similar domains</strong>: http://www.abcbank-security.com/ </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Off by one URLs</strong>: http://www.abcbonk.com/ </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Different languages or encodings</strong>: http://www.abcbànk.com </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Obscure URL features</strong>: Some browsers allow the user to provide credentials in the address bar. This is done by preceding the real address with the credentials and the @ (at) symbol, such as: http://www.abcbank.com@attacker.com. <p>In this example the user would be directed to attacker.com with the credentials of www.abcbank.com which can easily be disregarded by the attacker's website.</p></li>

  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>In this attack the goal is to discover the key of a crypto system by controlling what ciphertext is decrypted. The attacker usually has access to a large number of encrypted messages and the equivalent of a tamperproof box that can do decryption. This type of attack is primarily applicable to asymmetric encryption algorithms but can also be applied to symmetric encryption algorithms as well. Another variant of this attack is the Adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack in which the attacker sends a number of ciphertexts to be decrypted then based on the plaintext that is returned the attacker chooses different ciphertext to be decrypted in the next round.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Discovery of the private key used in the system.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Allowing anonymous users to decrypt chosen ciphertext. </li>
    <li>Using an encryption algorithm that does not protect against this type of attack.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>For RSA encryption use Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding. </li>
    <li>Deny anonymous users the ability to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext.</li>

  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>A chosen plaintext attack (CPA) is a form of cryptanalysis where it is assumed that the attacker has access to a device that provides her the capability to choose arbitrary plaintexts to be encrypted and obtain the corresponding ciphertexts.</p>
  <p>An attacker with such capabilities will perform the encryption of selected plaintexts and then analyze the resulting ciphertext in order to gain some further information that reduces the security of the encryption scheme. In the worst case, a chosen plaintext attack could reveal the scheme's secret key.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Disclosure of sensitive data </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Custom implementation of algorithm. </li>
    <li>Use of weak keys (e.g., a short key length). </li>
    <li>Exposing cipher text unnecesarily. </li>
    <li>Allowing an attacker to submit arbitrary data for encryption.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Use well-known implementations of well-known cryptographic algorithms. </li>
    <li>Use cryptographically generated random keys. </li>
    <li>Use large keys (128-bit symmetric or 1024-bit asymmetric keys). </li>
    <li>Utilize platform supplied features to store secret keys. </li>
    <li>Follow principle of least privilege to provide limited access to the secret key. </li>
    <li>Maintain key outside of the application domain (e.g., for a Web server, keep the key outside of the webroot). </li>
    <li>If using a symmetric cipher, utilize a unique random IV to hide the underlying character pattern of the plain text and use a chaining mode to prevent the replacement of individual blocks of the cyphertext. </li>
    <li>If using a cryptographic hash algorithm, salt the hash value with a unique random bit stream.</li>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Many web applications use URL redirection as a feature to direct a user to another site or page on the same site. An attacker may be able to leverage this vulnerability to trick users into entering sensitive information into a malicious website while seemingly navigating within a trusted website.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Website forgery</strong>: If an attacker can redirect a user from one trusted site to another site, the victim may not notice the redirection and extend trust to a malicious web site.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Improper use of redirection. </li>
    <li>Failure to properly alert the user when a redirection is about to occur.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Never allow silent redirects to a user specified URL, even if the hostname is fixed.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Example</h1>
  <p>The login page for a web application has a feature that redirects the user, with a full query string, to a specified page within the site after the user logs in. This is used to allow pages to force the user to login before they are accessed, without losing track of the page the user was attempting to load. Unfortunately, this application also has pages, which alter the application state with a single get request. This combination allows an attacker to craft a single URL which will ask the user for their credentials on the legitimate login page, and subsequently perform some action as that user, without the user's knowledge. In order to fix this, the redirect links should be signed by the application in some way and protected against replay, thus guaranteeing that only legitimate uses of the feature will occur. Additionally, redirect strings should be passed as POST variables thus preventing attackers from crafting links that look like they are part of the legitimate site.</p>
  <p>In another example, a page has a utility function which allows developers to construct transparent redirects to other sites. This allows a phishing group to construct a seemingly legitimate URL on the application site which redirects silently to a malicious site. They can then pass this URL out to unsuspecting users, who can be tricked into visiting the malicious site while believing they're using the legitimate one.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>A Cross Site Request Forgery attack occurs when an attacker tricks a victim into loading a page that contains a malicious request. This request may be able to change the state of the web application and is possible because the request is sent in the context of the logged in victim. For many sites each request automatically sends the victim's credentials such as the session cookie or authentication credentials. Due to this fact there is no way to distinguish the false request from a legitimate request.</p>
  <p>Cross Site Request Forgery attacks are known by other names including XSRF, Session Riding, One-Click and Zero-Click attacks. </p>
  <p>A One-Click attack refers to a link that causes a malicious action to be performed when a victim clicks on it. A Zero-Click attack is automatically executed upon page load. A common way to perform a zero-click attack is to embed the request in the source of an image.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Elevation of privilege</strong> - the attacker can execute commands on the web application on behalf of the victim</p>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <p>Executing single requests that can change the state of the application, such as add users, change account balances or passwords, etc.</p>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a session identifier or nonce value to each session and/or viewstate to track each request. </li>
    <li>Use "double submit" cookies (for Ajax requests only). </li>
    <li>Minimize single request GET commands. </li>
    <li>Never allow a single request to change the state of the web application.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Example</h1>
  <p>If the application allows a user to change the state of the application in a single request this attack is possible. In this example the web application allows a logged in administrator to create a new user sending a single GET request.</p>
  <p>This GET request looks like this:</p>
  <pre>GET http://teammentorexample.com/adduser.aspx?username=joe&amp;password=1234&amp;usertype=userHTTP/1.1</pre>
  <p>The attacker discovers that this request will create a new user and creates his own request which he embeds in an e-mail with the following image tag:</p>
  <pre>&lt;img src="http://teammentorexample.com/adduser.aspx?username=HACKER&amp;password=TEST&amp;usertype=admin" /&gt;</pre>
  <p>When the victim's e-mail client attempts to download the image located at the above source the request is made without the knowledge of the victim. </p>
  <p>The application should require a two step authorization mechanism for any change to server state. In this example the server should send the client a nonce value to verify the admin would indeed like to add this user. The admin would have to verify the action on a separate page and return the nonce value. Only after the server receives the action and verifies the nonce should the user be created. </p>

  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Command injection problems are a subset of injection problems in which the process is tricked into either executing code or calling external processes of the attacker's choice through the injection of control information into the data stream.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Elevation of Privilege:</strong> Command injection can allow for the execution of arbitrary commands and code by the attacker. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Failure to Validate User Input:</strong> Situations where control information and data are mixed create opportunities for command injection.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Validate user input</strong>. Prevent commands from being included in data by validating input for type, length, range, and format. Whitelist acceptable input and reject everything else. Escape meta characters and be aware of canonicalization issues. Remember that data may be changed as it flows through the program, so validating at multiple stages is often appropriate. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Do not use input data in commands directly</strong>. Clever formatting may be used so that the user's input is treated as its own separate command instead of as data. Therefore, validate the input and explicitly type it as data so that it cannot be interpreted as a command even if it contains one. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid using command interpreters</strong>. Although not always practical, using a well maintained API will have better results than invoking commands through an interpreter or external process.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Example</h1>
  <p>The following code is a web wrapper around the ImageMagick command "convert":</p>
  <pre>&lt;?php
$filename=$_GET['file'];
$old_fmt=$_GET['old'];
$new_fmt=$_GET['new'];

$cmd = 'convert $filename.$old_fmt $filename.$new_fmt 2&gt;&amp;1';
echo `$cmd`;
?&gt;
</pre>
  <br />
  <br />This could be used as part of an image upload page where a user posts an image, it is saved to the file system, then this call is performed asynchronously. There are multiple issues with such a flow, but the most critical is the command injection vulnerability it introduces. Consider what a URL might look like under normal operation:<br /><br /><pre>http://example.com/convert.php?file=kittycat&amp;old=png&amp;new=jpg</pre><br /><br />This would construct a command that would look like the following:<br /><br /><pre>convert kittycat.png kittycat.jpg 2&gt;&amp;1</pre><br /><br />If the file exists the page would return nothing; if the file does not exist or there is another problem lack of error handling would disclose sensitive information about how the script works back to the user. Even worse than the information that an attacker could obtain through this is the fact that she can now execute arbitrary commands. Consider the following URL:<br /><br /><br /><pre>http://example.com/convert.php?file=kittycat&amp;old=png&amp;new=jpg%3bcat+%2fetc%2fpasswd</pre><br />This would construct a much more dangerous command:<br /><br /><pre>convert kittycat.png kittycat.jpg; cat /etc/passwd 2&gt;&amp;1</pre><br /><br />The <font face="Courier New">convert</font> command would likely silently succeed followed by the <font face="Courier New">cat</font> command which would dump the contents of <font face="Courier New">/etc/passwd</font> back to the attacker. Note that even though in this example the attacker sees feedback from the injection, methods exist for exploiting scenarios where injection displays no output. In such cases an attacker could, for example, use the <font face="Courier New">sleep</font> command to detect the existence of a blind injection issue. Once found, such a vulnerability is easily exploited. <br /><br />
Another example of this type of behavior can be seen with XSL, the style sheet language for XML. The primary purpose of XSL is to provide an easy and modular way to transform XML documents into other XML documents such as HTML. In particular, different XSL styles can be attached to the same XML and are sometimes supplied by the user. Microsoft extended the functionality of XSL to allow scripting code to be embedded in the style sheets with the &lt;msxsl:script&gt; tag. If an attacker has the ability to modify or replace the XSL style sheet in use, they can therefore inject any command to the system running the application simply by including it in the style sheet.
  <p>In many programming languages there is an eval() function that, as the name suggests, evaluates a string as an expression. Among the members of this list are the commonly used JavaScript, ASP, Python, Perl, Ruby, and PHP. Blurring the distinction between data and code presents a huge security risk; this case is no different. User input is sometimes used in eval() expressions allowing arbitrary code to be executed. Consider an example where eval() is used in a php to set variables equal to one based on GET parameters:</p><pre>$turn_on=explode('|', $_GET['var']);

foreach ($turn_on as $var){
    eval('$var = 1');
}
</pre><p>The developer may expect a URL that looks like the following:</p><pre>http://example.com/set.php?turn_on=foo|bar|baz</pre><br /><br /><font face="Arial">This would result in evaluations that could be represented with the following code:<br /><br /></font><pre>foo=1;
bar=1;
baz=1;
</pre><p>However, imagine instead that the user tried a different URL:</p><pre>http://example.com/set.php?turn_on=foo%3d1%3bphpinfo()%3bbar|baz</pre><p>The evaluated code would look a little different:</p><pre>foo=1; <br />phpinfo();<br />bar=1;<br />baz=1;<br /></pre><p>Rather than simply set variables to 1, the script now outputs to an attacker information about the installation and configuration of PHP on the system he is attacking. Any system command or external program in the path could be run in this fashion.</p><h1>Additional Resources</h1><ul><li>For more information on Command Injection, see the <a href="http://www.e-articles.info/e/a/title/Command-Injection/">Command Injection </a>article at e-articles.info. </li><li>For more information on the Javascript Eval function, see the Wikipedia Eval article at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eval">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eval</a>.</li></ul><ul></ul>]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Applies To</h1>
  <p>Any application that can manipulate XML documents through Xpath/XQuery </p>
  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>An Xpath/XQuery attack exploits vulnerabilities in input validation to run arbitrary commands in XML databases. This attack works in much the same way as a SQL injection attack but with an XML target instead of a SQL target. This attack can occur when your application uses input directly from a user to construct an Xpath/XQuery statement to access XML tables. Using the Xpath/XQuery attack the attacker can execute arbitrary Xpath/XQuery statements on an XML database. This attack is often more damaging than a SQL injection attack as permissions are not enforced and the attacker’s query can access every part of the XML document. With an Xpath/XQuery attack it is possible to retrieve, manipulate, and destroy any data stored in the XML document.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Since XML generally holds sensitive data, loss of confidentiality is a frequent problem with XPath/XQuery injection vulnerabilities. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Authentication:</strong> If poor XPath/XQuery commands are used to check user names and passwords, it may be possible to connect to a system as another user with no previous knowledge of the password. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Authorization:</strong> If authorization information is held in an XML document, it may be possible to change this information through the successful exploitation of an XPath/XQuery injection vulnerability. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Integrity:</strong> Just as it may be possible to read sensitive information, it is also possible to make changes or even delete this information with an XPath/XQuery injection attack. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Weak input validation. </li>
    <li>Generating XPath expressions by dynamically concatenating strings with user supplied data. </li>
    <li>Failure to escape single quotes, double quotes, and other potentially dangerous characters.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Constrain input.</strong> Use vigorous white-list style checking on any user input that may be used as part of an XQuery command. This will also help prevent meta characters from being added to your stored data set which will be used again. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use parameterized and precompiled XPath expressions in your XQuery instead of concatinating strings with user input.</strong> Parameterized Xpath statements will accept characters that have special meaning to Xpath (like single quote) without problems because they are strongly typed. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use escaping routines.</strong> If you cannot use parameters and must generate XPath expressions dynamically, use escaping routines to handle special characters that have meaning to the database. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Do not echo XQuery errors.</strong> Catch any exceptions on the server and return generic error messages to the client.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Example</h1>
  <p>Consider the following XML file, being used by an application to log users into the application</p>
  <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt; &lt;users&gt;    &lt;user&gt;       &lt;username&gt;admin&lt;/username&gt;       &lt;password&gt;8af2&amp;&lt;/password&gt;       &lt;account&gt;admin&lt;/account&gt;    &lt;/user&gt;    &lt;user&gt;       &lt;username&gt;user1&lt;/username&gt;       &lt;password&gt;password&lt;/password&gt;       &lt;account&gt;guest&lt;/account&gt;    &lt;/user&gt;    &lt;user&gt;       &lt;username&gt;user2&lt;/username&gt;       &lt;password&gt;1234&lt;/password&gt;       &lt;account&gt;guest&lt;/account&gt;    &lt;/user&gt; &lt;/users&gt;</pre>
  <p>A developer could use the following Xpath command to return all the users with the username</p>
  <pre>‘user1’ and password ‘password’string(//user[username/text()='user1'        and password/text()='password']/account/text())</pre>
  <p>However, without proper input validation the attacker could easily input a logic statement to manipulate the output of the query. An attacker could provide the following string to the Xpath statement above.</p>
  <pre>Username: user1Password: ' or '1' = '1</pre>
  <p>This will change the Xpath statement to look like this:</p>
  <pre>string(//user[username/text()='user1' and password/text()=''        or '1' = '1']/account/text())</pre>
  <p>The password portion of the query will always resolve to true which means that the application will authenticate the attacker as user1 even though no password was provided.</p>
  <p>A good way to fix this example is to use a parameterized query. The idea here is to create a precompiled query that gets values from parameters instead of dynamically creating an XPath expression by concatenation at run time. Let $username and $password be string variables that hold the users input. Then construct a query in the following way:</p>
  <pre>"//user[user[username/text()=$username and password/text()=$password]"</pre>
  <p>If you are using .NET see the Additional Resources below for another example of how this works.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack can cause arbitrary code to run in a user's browser while the browser is connected to a trusted Web site. The attack targets your application's users and not the application itself, but it uses your application as the vehicle for the attack. Because the script code is downloaded by the browser from a trusted site, the browser has no way of knowing that the code is not legitimate. Internet Explorer security zones provide no defense. As the attacker's code has access to the cookies associated with the trusted site and are stored on the user's local computer, a user's authentication cookies are typically the target of attack. </p>
  <p>There are two primary types of XSS, persistent and non-persistent. If the attacker is able to inject his malicious script to the web applications data store, then the script will be persistent and anyone who then loads a page with that content will run the script and become a victim of the attack. Forums and other web services that have user supplied HTML content are a classic example of this. If this content is not validated and encoded then anyone can leave a malicious script on the site. Non-Persistent XSS uses some reflective aspect of the page to deliver the payload. Web applications often echo user input back to them without altering it. Search engines are a good example of this type of behavior. Attackers can create and distribute URLs that contain a malicious script that gets reflected back to the user. The most common example of this is the "page not found" error page which echoes the requested page back to the user.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Confidentiality: The most common attack performed with cross-site scripting involves the disclosure of information stored in user cookies. </li>
    <li>Access control: In some circumstances it may be possible to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer when cross-site scripting is combined with other flaws. </li>
    <li>Elevation of privilege: Even if an attacker cannot get at the authentication information of a user, they can act as that user.</li>

  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Failure to validate user input for script tags when that input can be echoed back into a web page. </li>
    <li>Trusting data retrieved from a shared database. </li>
    <li>Failing to encode any remotely provided data, including reverse DNS lookup, cookie contents, uploaded files, etc. </li>
    <li>Improperly converting "safe" tags to HTML. </li>
    <li>Displaying user input directly without encoding it appropriately for the context in which it is used. </li>
    <li>Checking user submitted data against a blacklist instead of a whitelist.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Perform context sensitive encoding of untrusted input before it is echoed back to a browser by using an encoding library (e.g., the Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library or OWASP Reform). The following language-specific functionality may be helpful, is not sufficient to properly protect against cross-site scripting; a whitelisting library should be used instead. Most of these libraries only convert the symbols ", &amp;, &lt;, and &gt; to safe HTML equivalents. <ul><li><strong>Python</strong>: cgi.escape (only escapes 3 characters by default, escaping " is optional) </li><li><strong>ASP</strong>: HttpUtility.HtmlEncode and HttpUtility.UrlEncode (only encodes 4 characters) </li><li><strong>Perl</strong>: HTML::Entities::encode (only escapes 4 characters by default, but it makes it easy to specify other unsafe characters) </li><li><strong>PHP</strong>: htmlentities and urlencode (only escapes 4 characters by default, and can optionally encode ' (single quote))</li></ul></li>
    <li>Untrusted input should be validated against an inclusion list before use. For example, use regular expressions to define acceptable character sequences and use it as a filter. If the input is meant to be a primitive type it can be cast appropriately to assure that it is the expected type (a type constraint) and then checked to ensure it's in appropriate range (a range constraint). In the case where there are only a limited number of acceptable inputs, then the input can be constrained to that set with simple if or switch control structures, or by matching against a fixed list of strings (a domain constraint).</li>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure URL Authorization is used&amp;nbsp;to control which users and groups of users have access to specific pages or the application itself.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Rather than having to password-protect pages, URL Authorization allows you to tie page access to user accounts or roles.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check if your application uses URL Authorization:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <div>Check if your application has an&amp;nbsp;&lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; element in its Web.config file.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>Check to ensure that the users, roles and access rights listed in the &lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; element match to your application's requirements.</div>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Below is an example of the &lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; element configured to deny access to all but a few chosen users and roles:</p>
  <pre>&lt;authorization&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;allow users="DomainName\Bob, DomainName\Mary" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;allow roles="BUILTIN\Administrators, DomainName\Manager" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;deny users="*" /&gt;<br />&lt;/authorization&gt;<br /></pre>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To configure URL authorization, use an &lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; element in Web.config and specify which user and/or role names are allowed access to the current directory or the nominated directory or file. ASP.NET on Windows Server 2003 or later protects all files in a given directory, even those not mapped to ASP.NET, such as .html, .gif, and .jpg files. </p>
  <p>Authorization settings in Web.config refer to all of the files in the current directory and all subdirectories unless a subdirectory contains its own Web.config with an &lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; element. In&amp;nbsp;such a&amp;nbsp;case, the settings in the subdirectory override the parent directory settings. </p>
  <p>URL authorization can be used for both forms authentication and Windows authentication. In the case of Windows authentication, user names take the form "DomainName\WindowsUserName" and role names take the form "DomainName\WindowsGroupName". The local administrators group is referred to as "BUILTIN\Administrators". The local users group is referred to as "BUILTIN\Users". </p>
  <p>The following example shows Windows users and Windows roles: </p>
  <pre>&lt;authorization&gt;<br />  &lt;allow users="DomainName\Bob, DomainName\Mary" /&gt;<br />  &lt;allow roles="BUILTIN\Administrators, DomainName\Manager" /&gt;<br />  &lt;deny users="*" /&gt;<br />&lt;/authorization&gt;  </pre>
  <p>The following example uses a custom role: </p>
  <pre>&lt;authorization&gt;<br />  &lt;allow roles="Manager"/&gt;<br />  &lt;deny users="*"/&gt;<br />&lt;/authorization&gt;  </pre>
  <p>To apply authorization rules to a specific file or folder, enclose the &lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; element inside a &lt;<strong>location</strong>&gt; element as shown here: </p>
  <pre>&lt;location path="Secure" &gt;<br />  &lt;system.web&gt;<br />    &lt;authorization&gt;<br />      &lt;deny users="?" /&gt;<br />    &lt;/authorization&gt;<br />  &lt;/system.web&gt;<br />&lt;/location&gt;  </pre>
  <p>This example denies access to unauthenticated users and forces a redirect to the login page that is specified on the &lt;<strong>forms</strong>&gt; element. </p>
  <p>The following example shows how you can apply authorization to a specific file (Page.aspx). </p>
  <pre>&lt;location path="page.aspx"&gt;<br />    &lt;authorization&gt;<br />        ...<br />    &lt;/authorization&gt;<br />&lt;/location&gt;  </pre>
  <p>If necessary, you can apply different authorization rules for separate pages based on the identity, or more commonly, the role membership of the caller, by using multiple &lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; elements within separate &lt;<strong>location</strong>&gt; elements. </p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that all input parameters from form fields, query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers are&amp;nbsp;validated.&amp;nbsp;Validation routines should check for length, range, format, and type. Validation should check first&amp;nbsp;for known valid and safe data and then for malicious, dangerous data.&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>An attacker passing malicious input can attempt SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other injection attacks that aim to exploit your application's vulnerabilities. &amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To check for this problem, use the following steps:&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Find all input parameter sources.</strong> During design time identify all of the potential sources of input parameters to your application. Scour the source code to discover sources of input that may have been missed in the design.&amp;nbsp; Compile a list that you can use in the following steps. The most common sources are:</p>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Form Fields </li>
      <li>Query Strings </li>
      <li>Cookies </li>
      <li>HTTP Headers</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Trace data from source to sink.</strong> Trace each of source of input through your application until you find its ultimate destination.&amp;nbsp; The final sink may be in memory, on the hard drive, sent over the network or stored in a database.&amp;nbsp; </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify validation routines.</strong> Each input source should have a data validation routine associated with it.&amp;nbsp; Ideally the validation will occur as soon after the input reaches your application as possible.&amp;nbsp; Shared validation routines are better than creating many spread throughout your code base, check for consolidation of routines to aid testing and reduce the chance of one-off bugs.&amp;nbsp; If an input source does not have a validation routine associated with it, flag it for fixing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure quality of validation routines.</strong> Validation routines&amp;nbsp;should check for length, range, format, and type. Validation should check first&amp;nbsp;for known valid and safe data and then for malicious, dangerous data.&amp;nbsp;Do not rely on filtering out all malicious data, it is too easy to miss something. Do not rely on client-side validation alone as it can be easily bypassed.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Check for known good data and constrain input by validating it for type, length, format, and range.&amp;nbsp; For Web form applications that obtain input through server controls, use the ASP.NET validator controls, such as the RegularExpressionValidator, RangeValidator, and CustomValidator, to validate and constrain input.&amp;nbsp; Check all numeric fields for type and range. If you are not using server controls, you can use regular expressions and the Regex class, and you can validate numeric ranges by converting the input value to an integer or double and then performing a range check.&amp;nbsp; Validate your input against the least permissive expression possible that will accept all the input you expect for that field.&amp;nbsp; If you know that the field will have certain internal structure, check for it.&amp;nbsp; If your input has an internal checksum, like a credit card number, check that too. </p>
  <p>Most Web applications accept input from various sources, including HTML controls, server controls, query strings, and cookies.&amp;nbsp; Validate input from all of these sources to help prevent injection attacks.&amp;nbsp; Use regular expressions to help validate input.&amp;nbsp; The following example shows how to use the Regex class. </p>
  <pre>using System.Text.RegularExpressions;<br />...
// Instance method:
Regex reg = new Regex(@"^[a-zA-Z'.\s]{1,40}$");<br />Response.Write(reg.IsMatch(Request.QueryString["Name"]));<br />// Static method:<br />if (!Regex.IsMatch(Request.QueryString["Name"],@"^[a-zA-Z'.\s]{1,40}$"))<br />{<br />   // Name does not match expression<br />}</pre>
  <p>If you cannot cache your regular expression for frequent use, you should use the static IsMatch method where possible for performance reasons, to avoid unnecessary object creation. </p>
  <p>Remember that validating input does not remove the need to format output, parameterize queries, or otherwise handle user input carefully. </p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An ASP.NET application contains an order form for a web store which has several fields, specifically, a name, address, phone number, item number, and quantity.&amp;nbsp; Each item is simply added to the database, with any typecasting handled by the database.&amp;nbsp; While casting to the appropriate type helps a little, it happens too late to prevent SQL injection issues.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, there are no guarantees about the quality of the data. </p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>An ASP.NET application contains an order for a web store. Each of the form's fields are validated, giving stronger guarantees about the data gathered.&amp;nbsp; The phone number&amp;nbsp;is validated as a string of ten digits (after stripping all non-numeric characters), or a variable number of digits beginning with the character '+' if international numbers are allowed.&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <p>Validating a name, address, and item number can all be a bit more complicated.&amp;nbsp; The first order of business is determining the legal character set for each case.&amp;nbsp; For names, spaces, upper and lower case letters (including the accented forms for your current codepage), and possible numbers and periods are enough.&amp;nbsp; Addresses need to add commas, hyphens, and number signs, at a minimum.&amp;nbsp; Validating item numbers may be as simple as casting to an integer and checking that the result is in the right range, or it may mean a more complicated regular expression that checks for internal formatting in a string. </p>
  <p>The last, optional step of data validation is to ensure that the data refers to a valid things.&amp;nbsp; The data should be validated for format first, especially as further checks may require database queries.&amp;nbsp; Item numbers are an obvious thing to check for existence in the DB, and this would normally happen as part of the stored procedure which creates a new order, but names, addresses, and phone numbers can be similarly checked, some times.&amp;nbsp; For example, if the address field is broken up into components, state or province information, zip/post codes, and city names, at a minimum, can all be validated against existing lists.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure your application forces the user to re-authenticate when executing security-critical functionality including, but not limited to change of password, account modifications and critical transactions</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Forcing the user to re-authenticate verifies the user's decision to execute the given functionality and preserves the application's integrity in the event that a user's account has been compromised via session hijacking.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all critical functionality within your application. </strong>Locate all critical functionality within your application's code base. Common places to look include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating new accounts </li>
        <li>Changing passwords for existing users </li>
        <li>User transactions that are sensitive in nature </li>
        <li>Changing your application's global configuration </li>
        <li>Any operation affecting your application's overall wellness such as start-up and shutdown</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure that your application has adopted a&amp;nbsp;re-authentication mechanism. </strong>Ensure that your application's design and requirements ask for re-authentication mechanisms. Common re-authentication mechanisms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Current password:</strong> The user uses their current password to confirm the identity. This technique ensures that the given user is aware of the action to be performed and holds responsibility for executing it. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CAPTCHA:</strong> CAPTCHA is a mechanism where alpha-numeric codes are embedded into displayed pictures. Forcing the user to confirm the embedded code ensures that the application is interacting with a human. If your application uses a CAPTCHA, ensure that the CAPTCHA generating software you are using is secure.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>2nd Factor:</strong> If your application supports a second factor of authentication such as a token, this could play a role in the re-authentication scheme.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that re-authentication is enforced. </strong>Ensure that the re-authentication procedures are positioned properly throughout your application's critical functionality. Verify that re-authentication is performed immediately upon entering a critical component. Example:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>public boolean changePassword(String user, char[] oldPass, char[] newPass)<br />{<br />      // The application forces re-authentication<br />      if(!validateUser(user, oldPass))<br />      {<br />            return false;<br />      }<br />      // Logic to critical functionality<br /> }  </pre>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Follow these steps when forcing re-authentication:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify critical functionality.</strong> Evaluate your application's design and requirements and determine what parts and resources of your application are very important to your organization's business model or your application's security architecture. This could include activities such as financial transactions or resetting user passwords.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Adopt re-authentication mechanism.</strong> Establish a mechanism that requires the user to verify their authenticity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Current password.</strong> The user uses their current password to confirm the identity. This technique ensures that the given user is aware of the action to be performed and holds responsibility for executing it. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CAPTCHA.</strong> CAPTCHA are mechanisms designed to ensure that a human, not an automated script, is using the system. Using a CAPTCHA should be seen as a way of augmenting a password in this kind of situation, not a way of replacing it. Many CAPTCHA systems embed distorted letters or numbers into displayed images which the user must enter. There are a number of problems with many CAPTCHA systems, so they should not be relied on too heavily. First, many graphical CAPTCHAs can be trivially broken by optical character recognition systems, and ensuring that a CAPTCHA is sufficiently strong to be useful without having too high of a failure rate for real users is difficult. If CAPTCHAs are reused, the attacker can simply record the session IDs of CAPTCHAs with known values and replay them. CAPTCHAs can also be broken by using a man-in-the-middle technique where the image is saved and forwarded to another site controlled by the attacker. An unsuspecting user of that site solves the CAPTCHA and the attacker forwards the answer to the victim site. CAPTCHAs also create accessibility problems for users, as blind and sometimes even color-blind individuals can find them impossible. If you choose to implement a CAPTCHA, be aware of the trade-offs involved and ensure that the system you use is appropriately protected against the attacks you expect to see. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2nd Factor.</strong> If your application supports a second factor of authentication such as a token, this could play a role in the re-authentication scheme.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Enforce the re-authentication mechanism.</strong> Once the critical functionality is identified and the re-authentication mechanism is established, enforce the re-authentication mechanism before all security-critical actions.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code allows a user to change their credentials. Unfortunately, the code enters the new credentials into the credentials repository without verifying that it is the actual user changing the credentials.</p>
  <pre>public boolean changePassword(String user, char[] newPass)<br />{<br />       // The application fails to re-authenticate the user<br />       // Verify that new password meets password requirements<br />       // Update the credential store with the new password<br />}</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code allows a user to change their credentials. Before entering the new credentials into the credentials repository, the code verifies that it is the actual user changing the credentials.</p>
  <pre>public boolean changePassword(String user, char[] oldPass, char[] newPass)<br />{<br />      // The application forces re-authentication<br />      if(!validateUser(user, oldPass))<br />      {<br />            return false;<br />      }<br />      // Verify that new password meets password requirements<br />      // Update the credential store with the new password<br />}</pre>]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that type safe SQL parameters are used when performing database transactions.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Attackers can use a SQL Injection Attack to manipulate the database in unforeseen ways. SQL injection allows an attacker to assume the credentials of the SQL account used to connect to the database, which may lead to arbitrary reading, writing, updating or deleting of data. In an improperly secured database, this can also lead to remote code execution through the use of certain stored procedures that allow for direct Operating System command injection.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To check if parameterized queries are used:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all database transactions. </strong>Locate all SQL queries throughout your application. Example:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>"select user from myappUsers where user = ? and pass = ?;"</pre>

  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code validates the user based on a given username and password. It hashes the password with a random salt. Then it compares the username and the produced hash against the data stored in the backend database. Unfortunately, the SQL query is dynamically crafted by using the user's input. If there is no proper input validation, an attacker can access the application's database server through the use of SQL injection.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />      // Hash the credentials before querying the credential store<br />      // The application crafts the SQL query based on user's input<br />      Connection cn = MyApp.getDBConnection();<br />      Statement st = cn.createStatement();<br />      String query = "select login_attempts from myappUsers where user = \""<br />                    + user + "\" and pass = \"" + passHash + "\";";<br />      ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery(query);<br />      // Execute the rest of the authentication steps<br />}</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that user-supplied filenames or paths are in the correct format and point to a valid location in the context of your application. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Malicious file input can be used to coerce your application into accessing arbitrary files and resources. </p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>If your application accepts user supplied files or paths, ensure that they are passed through a validation routine. The validation routine should not only check for appropriate format, but also ensure that the file name is legitimate for your application.</p>
  <p>For more information on input validation, see the related checklist item All Input is Validated for Length, Range, Format, and Type, linked below. </p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to fix this issue:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check File Names. </strong>Ensure that file paths only refer to files within your application's virtual directory hierarchy if that is appropriate. When checking file names, obtain the full name of the file by using the <strong>System.IO.Path.GetFullPath</strong> method. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check File Paths. </strong>If you use <strong>MapPath</strong> to map a supplied virtual path to a physical path on the server, use the overloaded <strong>Request.MapPath</strong> method that accepts a <strong>bool</strong> parameter so that you can prevent cross-application mapping. The following code example shows this technique:</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>try<br />{<br /> string mappedPath = Request.MapPath( inputPath.Text,<br />                                       Request.ApplicationPath, false);<br />}<br />catch (HttpException)<br />{<br /> // Cross-application mapping attempted <br />}</pre>
    <p>The final <strong>false</strong> parameter prevents cross-application mapping. This means that a user cannot successfully supply a path that contains ".." to traverse outside of your application's virtual directory hierarchy. Any attempt to do this results in an exception of type <strong>HttpException</strong>.</p>

  <p>Check to ensure that strong account and password policies are enforced for the server.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To counter password guessing and brute force dictionary attacks on your application, apply strong password policies. To enforce a strong password policy:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Set</strong>
      <strong>password length and complexity</strong>. Require strong passwords to reduce the threat of password guessing attacks or dictionary attacks. Strong passwords are eight or more characters and must include both alphabetical and
 numeric characters. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Set</strong>
      <strong>password expiration</strong>. Passwords that expire regularly reduce the likelihood that an old password can be used for unauthorized access. Frequency of expiration is usually guided by a company's security policy.
</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Table&amp;nbsp;below shows the default and recommended password policy settings.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Password Policy Default and Recommended Settings</strong>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that type-safe parameters are used when constructing dynamic SQL queries or when passing parameters to stored procedures.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>If you use the Parameters collection, SQL treats the input is as a literal value rather then as executable code. The Parameters collection can be used to enforce type and length constraints on input data. Values outside of the range trigger an exception.</p>
  <p>If type-safe SQL parameters are not used, attackers might be able to execute injection attacks that are embedded in the unfiltered input.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To check if parameterized queries are used:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all database transactions. </strong>Locate all SQL queries throughout your application. Example:</p>
      <pre>"select user from myappUsers where user = ? and pass = ?;"</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that each transaction uses Stored Procedures where possible. </strong>Verify that your application interacts with the backend database through the use of Stored Procedures. Ensure that SQL queries look like:</p>
      <pre>SqlCommand myCommand = new SqlCommand("sp_SelectUser", myConnection);<br />//Specify our command is a stored procedure<br />myCommand.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure; </pre>
      <p>and not like:</p>
      <pre>string SQLstr = "SELECT * from users<br />   WHERE username = '" + un.Text + "'<br />   AND password = '" + pass.Text + "'";<br />SqlCommand myCommand = new SqlCommand(SQLstr, myConnection);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that type-safe parameters are used. </strong>Verify that type-safe parameters are used in the dynamic SQL queries or stored procedures by using the SqlParameterCollection class. Example:</p>
      <pre>using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))<br />{<br />  connection.Open();<br />  SqlDataAdapter myDataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(<br />         "SELECT * from users WHERE username = '@uname' AND password = '@pwd'", connection);<br />  myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add("@uname", SqlDbType.VarChar, 24);<br />  myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add("@pwd", SqlDbType.VarChar, 16);<br />  myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters["@uname"].Value = un.Text;<br />  myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters["@pwd"].Value = pass.Text;<br />  myDataAdapter.Fill(userDataset);  ...  connection.Close();<br />}</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>Consider an ASP.NET application that handles employee payroll functionality for a small company. One of the pages requires retrieving an employee record from a table based on a username and password supplied via a login dialog. The developer of the application created an SQL SELECT query to accomplish said task:</p>
  <pre>using (SqlConnection myConnection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))<br />{<br />  connection.Open();<br />  string SQLstr = "SELECT * from users WHERE username = '" + un.Text + "'<br />   AND password = '" + pass.Text + "'";<br />  SqlCommand myCommand = new SqlCommand(SQLstr, myConnection);<br />  SqlDataAdapter myDataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(myCommand);<br />  myCommand.Connection.Open();<br />  SqlDataReader myReader = myCommand.ExecuteReader();<br />  ...<br />}</pre>
  <p>In the preceding example, the SELECT statement will work as expected, assuming that the input is perfectly constrained. However, what happens if a user enters unexpected input such as '1234' for a password, and this for a username:</p>
  <pre>mjones' AND 1=1; -- </pre>
  <p>This will result in the SQL statement being executed at the database level:</p>
  <pre>SELECT * from users WHERE username = 'mjones' AND 1=1; --'  AND password = '1234';</pre>
  <p>This will allow the person entering data into the dialog box to select the account details of mjones without the correct password.</p>

  <p>Ensure that the communication channels are encrypted when interacting with other software across the network.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Encrypting the communication links allows the application to preserve confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to ensure that your application's communication links are encrypted:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the connections used for transmitting sensitive data. </strong>Identify the sensitive data that is sent over the network and enumerate&amp;nbsp;the respective connections that are used for such communication.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that connections are secured. </strong>Using a network sniffer, verify that your application utilizes either IPSec or TLS/SSL then check the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>IPSec</strong>:&amp;nbsp;If your application uses IPSec, verify that&amp;nbsp;all packets from your sniffed traffic between the specified hosts contain an Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) fields after the IP headers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>TLS/SSL</strong>:&amp;nbsp;If your application uses TLS/SSL, verify that&amp;nbsp;your sniffed traffic between the specified hosts contains an SSL handshake. Keep in mind the following considerations when verifying your application's use of SSL:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Certificate Validity</strong>: Verify that your application's SSL certificate has not reached its expiration date. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Certificate Version</strong>: Verify that your application uses an SSL version 3.0 certificate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Domain Name</strong>: Verify that the domain name for your application's administrative interface is the same as the domain name listed in the SSL certificate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Chain of Trust</strong>: Verify that your application's users can verify your application's SSL certificate based on the root certificates that are stored in their browsers. If your application uses self-signed SSL certificates, ensure that your organization's root certificate is securely imported into the users' browsers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Server Configuration</strong>: Verify that your application's environment has enabled HTTPS. Verify that transactions of sensitive nature are made over HTTPS connections. Check if your application's deployment descriptor (e.g. web.xml) has the <em>transport-guarantee</em> element set to <em>CONFIDENTIAL</em>:</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To encrypt the communication links:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the connections used for transmitting sensitive data. </strong>Enumerate all connections between the different servers, with other servers or with the application. Identify the sensitive data that is sent over the network and the respective connections that are used for such communication.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose the appropriate encryption mechanism. </strong>Depending on the infrastructure, you may consider using IPSec or TLS/SSL.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>IPSec:</strong> IPSec is used when the encryption needs to be applied across all involved parties. Since IPSec is designed to secure connections between static hosts that are "always on," use IPSec to secure the network connections between your application's servers. Due to its nature, IPSec requires low level support; therefore, your application would need support from the operating system or a JNI component to manage it. </li>

          <strong>TLS/SSL:</strong> TLS/SSL provides a granular protection which&amp;nbsp;allows only&amp;nbsp;the traffic containing sensitive data to be encrypted. Because TLS/SSL has a certificate based design, it allows the protection of data transferred between mobile hosts. Use TLS/SSL to secure the communication channel between your application and its users.<br /><br />While Java provides APIs for handling SSL encrypted traffic, it is recommended to follow the manuals associated with the&amp;nbsp;third party software that&amp;nbsp;is being used. For example, if your application connects to a database server, follow the database server's manual on setting up the encryption; if your application is web-oriented, follow the web server's documentation on setting up the SSL certificate. If your application uses SSL, ensure that you use SSL 3.0 and disable the cryptographically weak SSL 2.0 protocols.</li>

      <p>
        <strong>Apply the appropriate encryption mechanism. </strong>Apply the encryption mechanism of choice at the appropriate locations in the code. Such locations include all functionality that establishes a connection between your application and another entity.</p>

  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code establishes a connection between&amp;nbsp;two servers. Unfortunately, the communication is not encrypted; therefore, it is possible for an attacker to eavesdrop on the connection.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that all echoed input is first encoded.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Encoding echoed input prevents injection attacks such as cross-site scripting.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>An application can take input via various&amp;nbsp;sources, such as a web interface, database, file system or other software running on the server, and then use that same input in various outputs. Use the following steps to establish a validation strategy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all sources of input. </strong>At design time identify all potential sources of input to your application. Once implemented, scour source code to discover sources of input that may have been missed in the design. Potential sources of input in a web application typically include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>URL based parameters </li>
        <li>Form based parameters </li>
        <li>Hidden fields </li>
        <li>Cookies </li>
        <li>HTTP headers (Host, accept types, www authentication, cache settings, encodings, etc) </li>
        <li>Local filesystem </li>
        <li>Database </li>
        <li>Other services running on the system </li>
        <li>Javascript variables </li>
        <li>File upload and attributes (filename, size, data, etc) </li>
        <li>DNS results or host names </li>
        <li>External component call return values (COM, AJAX, ActiveX) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you&amp;nbsp;have listed the sources of input your application&amp;nbsp;can use, look for all entry points. Good starting points are method parameters and assignment statements. For example: </p>
      <p>This method uses the <em>searchTerm</em> variable.</p>
      <pre>void aggregateData(PrintWriter out, String searchTerm)<br /> ...<br /><br />double[] rData = common.queryDBForIndex(searchTerm);</pre>
      <p>This assignment stores data from a <em>GET</em> request parameter named <em>index</em> and stores it in the string <em>searchTerm</em>. Ensure that this input is validated.</p>
      <pre>String searchTerm = request.getParameter("index");</pre>
      <p>This assignment uses the input that was gathered above to store more input from a database. Verify that <em>searchTerm</em> is validated before this use, and also ensure that <em>rData</em> is validated as another source of input.</p>
      <pre>double[] rData = common.queryDBForIndex(searchTerm);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Trace data from source to sink. </strong>Trace each source of input from the immediate source, through your application, to its final destination. The final sink may be in memory, on the hard drive, sent over the network or stored in a data store such as a database. Create a list of the input sources that are echoed back to the user through output - whether directly, through a file, in a URL or through a database or other intermediary source.</p>
      <p>Input used as output may be identified by the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>out.println() </li>
        <li>append() </li>
        <li>insert() </li>
        <li>write() </li>
        <li>Assignment operator (=) </li>
        <li>Increment and assignment operator (+=) </li>
        <li>Database write operations</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <p>
          <strong>Ensure input is properly encoded before being used as output</strong>. Each of the input sources identified above should have the input encoded properly before it is used as output. Encoding must be selected appropriately based upon how the output is returned to the client. Verify the context in which the output is used and ensure it is properly encoded. A couple example contexts are shown below (URL, HTML entity)</p>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>URL Encoding- <em>URLEncoder.encode(output)</em></li>
        <li>HTML Entity Encoding&amp;nbsp;- JSP HTML encoding: <em>&lt;c:out value="${output}" /&gt;</em></li>
        <li>
          <span>HTML Attribute Encoding</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>JavaScript Encoding</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>CSS Encoding</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>DOM Encoding</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span>
        <p>Beware that certain locations may require a mixed encoding, such as initially performing URL encoding, then performing JavaScript encoding. This depends entirely on the output context wherein the data is used, and requires knowledge of the parsing mechanisms of browsers. Some example encodings are below.</p>
      </span>
      <p />User URL provided: <pre>http://server/form?x=<strong>"&gt;&lt;SCRIPT&gt;alert('XSS');&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</strong></pre><p>No encoding:</p><pre>&lt;form action="http://server/form?x=<strong>"&gt;&lt;SCRIPT&gt;alert('XSS');&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</strong>"&gt;</pre><p>URL Encoding:</p><pre>&lt;form action="http://server/form%3Fx%3D<strong>%22%3E%3CSCRIPT%3Ealert%28%27XSS%27%29%3B%3C/SCRIPT%3E</strong>"&gt;</pre><p>HTML Encoding:</p><pre>&lt;form action="http://server/form?x=<strong>"&lt;&lt;SCRIPT&lt;alert('XSS');&lt;/SCRIPT&lt;</strong>"&gt;</pre></li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Encoding the echoed user input prevents injection attacks such as cross-site scripting. Use the following steps to ensure all echoed input is encoded:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all echoed input. </strong>Locate all places inside your application where user-supplied data will be returned to the client. Such data can be of a reflective or persistent nature:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Reflective</strong>: In a reflective setting, the input is immediately returned to the client. For example, search engines present the searched query when displaying the results. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Persistent</strong>: In a persistent setting, the input is stored and returned to the client when retrieved from the database. For example, message boards store the users' posts inside a database and return them when a given topic is viewed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Determine the&amp;nbsp;type of encoding. </strong>After identifying all echoed input, determine how the input is returned to client. Data is said to be in a HTML context when that data is rendered as a part of a HTML document and is understood by the browser to be HTML. There are other contexts available to Web Applications, such as JavaScript context, CSS context, etc. Data is said to be in a JavaScript context when it is included in JavaScript code and is interpreted as JavaScript by the browser, and so on. Data has to be encoded differently for different contexts to prevent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. The differences of encoding arise from the fact that different contexts have different special symbols and keywords. Output encoding routines have to be designed with the understanding of the context of the output in mind.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>URL encoding</strong>: URL encoding allows your application to maintain the original URL, yet display it to the user in a non-malicious way. Because HTTP headers allow a substitution schema, all characters/symbols are preserved by displaying their ASCII codes instead of the actual character/symbol. For example, <em>&lt;</em> is represented by <em>%3C</em> where <em>3C</em> is the ASCII value for <em>&lt;</em>:</p>
          <pre>String encodedUrl = URLEncoder.encode(url);</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>HTML encoding</strong>: HTML encoding is used when the echoed input is returned as regular text or HTML content. Input should be encoded by substituting certain characters with their respective HTML entities.</p>
          <blockquote>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>HTML Attribute Encoding</strong>: HTML Attribute encoding is used to encode dynamic data that is output in an attribute of an HTML tag, except&amp;nbsp;URL, CSS, and JavaScript event handler attributes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>JavaScript Encoding</strong>: JavaScript encoding is used to encode dynamic data that is output into the JavaScript context, including certain event handlers in HTML tags.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>CSS Encoding</strong>: CSS encoding is used to encode dynamic data that is output into the CSS context.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>DOM Encoding</strong>: DOM encoding is used to encode dynamic data that is used in situations where the DOM is involved. These instances are more complicated and often involve multiple output contexts, which necessitates chaining in many circumstances.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Apply the encoding. </strong>After identifying the echoed input and determining the appropriate encoding method, apply the encoding before the input is returned to the client. There are different encoding libraries available. Different libraries have different capabilities and weaknesses. Please, refer to the vendor's documentation for each potential encoding library.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code produces a data analysis based on a financial index. Because it does not HTML encode the echoed input, the application is vulnerable to reflective cross-site scripting.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that your application has directory browsing disabled.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Directory browsing allows an attacker to browse your application's directory structure in search of unprotected files and components.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to ensure that your application has directory browsing disabled:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify if directory browsing is enabled. </strong>Navigate to your application's directories. Identify if your application's server returns the directory contents and not an HTTP error message.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Locate the default servlet's configuration. </strong>Open your application's deployment descriptor (e.g. web.xml) and locate the default servlet's configuration. If the default servlet is present, ensure it is mapped to the root directory of your application. Example: </p>
      <pre>&lt;servlet&gt;<br />      &lt;servlet-name&gt;default_servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;<br />      &lt;servlet-class&gt;<br />            org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet<br />      &lt;/servlet-class&gt;&lt;/servlet&gt;&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;<br />      &lt;servlet-name&gt;default_servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;<br />      &lt;url-pattern&gt;/&lt;/url-pattern&gt;<br />&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>

  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to successfully disable directory browsing:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify if directory browsing is enabled. </strong>Navigate to your application's directories.

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Locate the default servlet's configuration. </strong>Open your application's deployment descriptor (e.g. web.xml), and locate the default servlet's configuration. If the default servlet is present, it is mapped to the root directory of your application. Example: </p>
      <pre>&lt;servlet&gt;<br />      &lt;servlet-name&gt;default_servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;<br />      &lt;servlet-class&gt;<br />            org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet<br />      &lt;/servlet-class&gt;<br />&lt;/servlet&gt;<br />&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;<br />      &lt;servlet-name&gt;default_servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;<br />      &lt;url-pattern&gt;/&lt;/url-pattern&gt;<br />&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Deny directory browsing in the default servlet's configuration. </strong>Initialize the default servlet with the parameter <em>listings</em> set to <em>false</em>. Example:</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that all users are assigned to specific roles. Verify that all access controls are performed on a per-role basis rather than a per-user basis.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Application roles allow multiple users to play the same role. This mechanism provides an easy and clear way to discover and manage the minimum privileges necessary for the execution of a given task. It provides a more robust and flexible way of managing the application's users.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to determine if your application uses role-based access controls:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check if your application uses user roles. </strong>Verify that your application has established user roles and grants the appropriate access privileges to each user role. Example:</p>
      <pre>Roles      Actions    Access Controls    Client Accounts<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />Manager    Connect        Always            Always<br />           Read           Always            Always<br />           Use            Always            Occasionally<br />           Modify         Never             Occasionally<br />Employee   Connect        Always            Always<br />           Read           Always            Always<br />           Use            Always            Always<br />           Modify         Never             Never</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure your application enforces role-based security. </strong>Verify that your application maps its access controls to the established user roles. Depending on your application's design, there are several ways of checking whether your application enforces role-based security:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Check for programmatical role-based security:</strong> If your application uses programmatic security, verify that JAAS is implemented correctly throughout the code. Use the following steps to ensure that access controls are positioned according to your application's security requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Identify all functionality that requires access controls:</strong> Using your application's design, identify all functionality that requires special privileges. Verify that each protected functionality has a permissions check associated with it. For instance, the following code verifies that the user has permission to connect to the application:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <pre>// The variable subject represents the user's identity an all<br />// security tokens that are associated with it<br />PrivilegedExceptionAction action = new AuthException("AccessApp");<br />Subject.doAsPrivileged(subject, action, null);</pre>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Note that <strong>AuthException</strong> is a custom implementation of the <strong>PrivilegedExceptionAction</strong> interface.&amp;nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Verify that all user roles' permissions comply with your application's security requirements:</strong> Examine your application's JAAS policy and verify that each user role is granted only the necessary set of permissions. Example:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <pre>grant Principal application.auth.GroupToken "users"<br />{<br />   permission java.security.SecurityPermission "AccessApp";<br />};</pre>
              </blockquote>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Check for declarative role-based security:</strong> If your application uses declarative security, examine its deployment descriptor file (e.g. <strong>web.xml</strong>). Verify that access to protected resources is granted according to the application's security requirements.&amp;nbsp;Verify that each <strong>web-resource-collection</strong> element inside the deployment descriptor is associated with the appropriate resource and user roles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>security-constraint</strong>: Check if all of your application's protected resources are placed within a <strong>security-constraint</strong> element. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>web-resource-collection</strong>: Check if all resources that share mutual access controls are encapsulated by the same <strong>web-resource-collection</strong> element. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>web-resource-name</strong>: Check if all collections of resources are identified by a name. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>url-pattern</strong>: For each collection of resources, verify that all resources are placed in the appropriate <strong>web-resource-collection</strong> elements. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>http-method</strong>: If your application requires access controls only for specific HTTP methods, verify that all of these methods are identified appropriately. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>auth-constraint</strong>: Check if each <strong>web-resource-collection</strong> element has an <strong>auth-constraint</strong> element associated with it. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>role-name</strong>: Verify that all roles are granted access according to your application's security requirements. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that users are assigned into their appropriate roles. </strong>List all of your application's users. Check if each user is assigned an appropriate role.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To apply this concept, the security checks within an application should be executed against a user's role rather than against the actual user.</p>
  <p>Use the following steps when designing the role-based security:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Understand the different types of users</strong>:&amp;nbsp;List the different types of users expected for the application.&amp;nbsp;Define&amp;nbsp;how they will use&amp;nbsp;the application, which resources they will&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;access, and any additional rules that will impact&amp;nbsp;how access will vary. Create a matrix mapping roles to resource by describing what action the role can take with each system asset. Use this matrix to identify the different types of users according to the functionality they need.</p>
      <pre>Role       Actions    Access Controls    Client Accounts<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />Manager    Connect        Always            Always<br />           Read           Always            Always<br />           Use            Always            Occasionally<br />           Modify         Never             Occasionally<br />Employee   Connect        Always            Always<br />           Read           Always            Always<br />           Use            Always            Always<br />           Modify         Never             Never</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Establish the roles</strong>: Define in code how each role can access each resource. There are two approaches when enforcing role-based security - programmatic and declarative:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Programmatically</strong>: The programmatic approach to role-based security is written inside the code and provides additional runtime flexibility.<br /><br />To enforce role-based security, you need to create a security policy for your application. If you implement this&amp;nbsp;approach using&amp;nbsp;Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) policies, you can execute a more focused set of security checks such as whether a user is allowed to access a particular resource or perform a specific action. When building the policy, create a role with associated permissions&amp;nbsp;for each type of user. For example, certain roles would be permitted to access the local filesystem while others would not.<br /></p>
          <pre>grant Principal application.auth.GroupToken "administrators"<br />{<br />  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "AccessApp";<br />  permission java.io.FilePermission “/tmp/myapp/cache”, “read,write”;<br />};<br />grant Principal application.auth.GroupToken "users"<br />{<br />  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "AccessApp";<br />};</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Declarative</strong>: The declarative approach to role-based security is declared within configuration files. While it doesn’t provide much flexibility in the development phase of the code, it allows easy manageability as the declarations can be modified without a recompile. By using the declarative approach, you can easily manage the security settings for the applications without a need to change the code.<br /><br />Java applications that use declarative security rely on a deployment descriptor (e.g. web.xml). The deployment descriptor uses the following elements for role-based security:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>security-constraint</strong>: Defines the access controls associated with a collection of resources as defined in the <em>web-resource-collection</em> element. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>web-resource-collection</strong>: Encapsulates a collection of resources that share mutual access controls. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>web-resource-name</strong>: Defines the name for the collection of resources. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>url-pattern</strong>: Identifies the URL of a resource that uses the access controls. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>auth-constraint</strong>: Defines the group of user roles that can access the collection of resources identified by the <em>web-resource-collection</em> element. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>role-name</strong>: Defines the roles that can access the collection of resources. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>http-method</strong>: Identifies the HTTP method upon which the access controls will be enforced. For example, your application may enforce access controls for POST requests, but not GET requests. If omitted, the access controls will apply to all HTTP methods. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <pre>&lt;!-- Application's web.xml --&gt;<br />&lt;security-constraint&gt;<br />      &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;<br />            &lt;web-resource-name&gt;Admin Commands&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;<br />            &lt;url-pattern&gt;/admin/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;<br />            &lt;url-pattern&gt;/config.do&lt;/url-pattern&gt;<br />      &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;<br />      &lt;auth-constraint&gt;<br />            &lt;role-name&gt;Admin&lt;/role-name&gt;<br />      &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;<br />&lt;/security-constraint&gt;<br /><br />&lt;login-config&gt;<br />      &lt;auth-method&gt;BASIC&lt;/auth-method&gt;<br />      &lt;realm-name&gt;Admin Realm&lt;/realm-name&gt;<br />&lt;/login-config&gt;<br /><br />&lt;!-- The following needs to be included if the application is to<br />     use form-based authentication --&gt;</pre>
          <p>In web.xml:</p>
          <pre>&lt;login-config&gt;<br />      &lt;auth-method&gt;FORM&lt;/auth-method&gt;<br />      &lt;form-login-config&gt;<br />            &lt;form-login-page&gt;/loginForm.jsp&lt;/form-login-page&gt;<br />            &lt;form-error-page&gt;/loginFailed.html&lt;/form-error-page&gt;<br />      &lt;/form-login-config&gt;<br />&lt;/login-config&gt;</pre>
          <p>In loginForm.jsp:</p>
          <pre>&lt;form method="POST" action="j_security_check"&gt;<br />&lt;input type="text" name="j_username"&gt;<br />&lt;input type="password" name="j_password"&gt;<br />&lt;input type="submit" value="log in"&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
          <p>Because declarative security asks the hosting server to handle authentication and authorization, there is the risk of disclosing connection strings, database credentials, etc.; therefore, use a JAAS LoginModule when using declarative security.<br /><br />Example using Tomcat (if you use a different environment, please consult its manual):</p>
          <pre>      &lt;!-- $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml --&gt;<br />      &lt;!-- JAAS authentication realm --&gt;<br />      &lt;Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.JAASRealm"<br />             appName="AppLoginConfig"<br />             userClassNames="application.auth.GroupToken"<br />             roleClassNames="application.auth.GroupToken"<br />             useContextClassLoader="false"<br />             debug="99"/&gt;</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Manage the users</strong>: Assign the users into their respective user roles. The application should apply the security policy according to the user roles instead of the actual user.</p>
      <pre>GroupToken groupToken = new GroupToken(groupName);<br />if(!subject.getPrincipals().contains(groupToken))<br />{<br />      subject.getPrincipals().add(groupToken);<br />}</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Consider using additional context when making security decisions</strong>: Simple examples include time of day and day of week. For instance, a given user may have no need to login to a system outside of the standard work hours, or even on the weekend. If that user attempts to login or perform some action in the middle of the weekend, it should not be allowed. Another example could be the user's phyisical location. If a user is expected to always use the system from their office in Chicago, but suddenly is connected in Eastern Europe, access should not be allowed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Consider using access control mechanisms provided by frameworks</strong>: Frameworks such as Spring Security (formerly Acegi) and Apache Shiro (formerly JSecurity), as well as others, seek to provide flexible but secure access control mechanisms that integrate neatly with current MVC frameworks and simplify security functionality.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment illustrates a JAAS policy. Because the application does not enforce role-based security, it has a policy entry for each separate user; therefore, changing the users' access rights can be quite difficult as each user needs to be modified individually.</p>
  <pre>grant Principal application.auth.UserToken "joe"<br />{<br />  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "AccessApp";<br />};<br />grant Principal application.auth.UserToken "steve"<br />{<br />  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "AccessApp";<br />};<br />grant Principal application.auth.UserToken "julie" <br />{<br />  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "AccessApp";<br />};</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment illustrates a JAAS policy. Because the application enforces role-based security, it has a policy entry for each group of users; therefore changing the users' access rights is easy as only the group needs to be modified.</p>
  <pre>grant Principal application.auth.GroupToken "users"<br />{<br />  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "AccessApp";<br />};</pre>]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure your application creates specific roles for different types of users. Verify when authorizing access to a resource that&amp;nbsp;security checks are performed on a per-role basis rather than on a per-user basis.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Application roles allow multiple users to play the same role. This mechanism provides a clear way to discover and manage the least privileges necessary for the execution of a given task and&amp;nbsp;provides a more robust&amp;nbsp;means of managing the application's users.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to determine if your application uses role-based access controls:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check if your application uses user roles.</strong> Verify that your application has established user roles and grants the appropriate access privileges to each user role. The roles and their privileges within the application should be defined in the documentation, to ensure that they have been examined in the context of the business purpose of the application, and to allow them to be checked against the application as implemented. Example:</p>
      <pre>Roles      Actions    Access Controls    Client Accounts<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />Manager    Connect        Always            Always<br />           Read           Always            Always<br />           Use            Always            Occasionally<br />           Modify         Never             Occasionally <br />Employee   Connect        Always            Always<br />           Read           Always            Always<br />           Use            Always            Always<br />           Modify         Never             Never</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure that your application enforces role-based security. </strong>Verify that your application maps its access controls to the established user roles.&amp;nbsp;Ensure that the roles used are sufficiently fine grained. Remember that the goal is to segment privileges within the application, not to simply control access to the entire application. Roles should be mapped to specific pages or functions within the application. Depending on your application's design, there are several ways of checking whether your application enforces role-based security: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Check for programmatically role-based security:</strong> If your application has security checks embedded inside its code base, identify all functionality that requires special privileges. Verify that each protected functionality has a permissions check associated with it.</p>
          <p>For example, the following code verifies that users are share holders before generating the appropriate financial report:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <pre>public void GenerateFinancialReport(DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (HttpContext.Current.User.IsInRole("ShareHolders"))<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Generate the relevant financial report<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />}<br /></pre>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Check for declarative role-based security:</strong> If your application uses declarative security, examine its <strong>web.config</strong> file. Verify that access to protected resources is granted according to the application's security requirements. Check that each resource is associated with the appropriate user roles in the configuration file: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>roleManager</strong>: Check that the ASP.NET role manager is configured using the <strong>roleManager</strong> element if form-based authentication is used. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>authorization</strong>: Check that the authorization settings for a resource are encapsulated by the <strong>authorization</strong> element. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>allow</strong>: Check that the users and roles that are allowed access to the given resource are enumerated. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>deny</strong>: Check that the users and roles that are denied access to the given resource are enumerated. <p>Example:</p><pre>&lt;configuration&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;system.web&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;roleManager enabled="true"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cacheRolesInCookie="false"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; defaultProvider="ProjectRoleProvider"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;providers&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;clear /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;add name="ProjectRoleProvider"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; type="System.Web.Security.SqlRoleProvider"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connectionStringName="ProjectConnection"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; applicationName="myapp" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;authorization&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;allow roles="Employees, Managers" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;deny users="*" /&gt;</pre></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Check for role-based security managed by Windows:</strong> If your application uses Windows <strong>Local Users and Groups</strong> to manage its role-based security needs, verify that your application's web.config is configured properly.</p>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre>&lt;configuration&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;system.web&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;authentication mode="Windows" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;authorization&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;allow roles="NTDomain\Employees, NTDomain\Managers" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;deny users="*" /&gt;</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that users are assigned into their appropriate roles. </strong>List all of your application's users.&amp;nbsp;Check if each user is assigned into their appropriate role. The application should apply the security policy according to the user roles instead of the actual user. Based on your application's mechanism to enforce role-based access controls, check that one of the following techniques is used to manage your application's users</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Programmatically:</strong> ASP.NET allows you to manage your application's users through the <strong>Roles</strong> class.</p>
          <p>Check that the following methods are used to assign users into roles: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>AddUserToRole</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AddUserToRoles</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AddUsersToRole</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AddUsersToRoles</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Check that the following methods are used to remove users from roles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>RemoveUserFromRole</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>RemoveUserFromRoles</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>RemoveUsersFromRole</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>RemoveUsersFromRoles </strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Declarative:</strong> Verify that the ASP.NET Role Manager is used to manage your application's users. To do so, connect to the database server that hosts your application's Role Manager. Using the following tables, verify that each user is assigned into the appropriate roles: <ul><li>aspnet_Users </li><li>aspnet_Roles </li><li>aspnet_UsersInRoles</li></ul></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Windows:</strong> If your application uses Windows authentication, use the Windows <strong>Local Users and Groups</strong> service to manage your application's users. If your application is connected to your organization's NT Domain or Active Directory forest, delegate the user and role management to your organization's network administrators.</p>
          <p>To use the Windows <strong>Local Users and Groups</strong> service:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Open <strong>Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Computer Management</strong>. </li>
            <li>Under the <strong>System Tools</strong> node in the navigation tree, select <strong>Local Users and Groups</strong>. </li>
            <li>Select <strong>Groups</strong>. </li>
            <li>For each role, double-click on the respective group. </li>
            <li>Verify that only the appropriate users are added as members for the given group. </li>
            <li>Click <strong>Cancel</strong>. </li>
            <li>Repeat steps 4-6 for all of your application's user roles.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment illustrates an application's access control policy. Because the application does not enforce role-based security, it has a policy entry for each separate user.&amp;nbsp;This will make&amp;nbsp;managing the users' access rights quite difficult when the number of users to the application grows.</p>
  <pre>&lt;authorization&gt;<br />  &lt;allow users="NTDomain\joe, NTDomain\sarah, NTDomain\bill, NTDomain\sue" /&gt;<br />  &lt;deny users="*" /&gt;<br />&lt;/authorization&gt;</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check that destinations of redirects and forwards are validated.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>If destinations of redirects or forwards are not validated, an attacker may create hyperlinks that appear to point to legitimate sites, but actually point to malicious pages controlled by the attacker. This technique is often used by phishers to trick people into visiting fake sites that steal authentication credentials. In some cases, a user may gain unauthorized access by manipulating redirect or forward parameters, if destinations are not validated.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to verify that destinations of redirects and forwards are validated:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify redirects and forwards.</strong> Review code to find all redirects and forwards.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enumerate destinations.</strong> Make a list of all destinations for each redirect and forward.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify access permissions.</strong> Determine circumstances under which it is acceptable for each user role to access each destination.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Examine each redirect and forward.</strong> Verify that each redirect and forward uses mapping values instead of fully-qualified urls to determine destinations. Review the code of each redirect and forward to make sure that all destinations are validated to assure that users can only access resources that are authorized for them. </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure validation of redirects and forwards:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify redirects and forwards.</strong> Review code to find all redirects and forwards.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Map destinations.</strong> Make a list of all destinations for each redirect and forward. Define mapping values for all destinations used by redirects and forwards. A mapping value is a short identifying string that symbolically represents a resource.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define access permissions.</strong> Determine circumstances under which it is acceptable for each user role to access each destination.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Validate redirects.</strong> Rewrite redirects and forwards to use mapping values as input to calculate the final destinations of redirects or forwards. Add validation routines to verify that the user has permissions to access the resource, which is the destination of the redirect or forward.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check that all input is validated and treated as untrusted data. Ensure data is validated using whitelisting techniques to check against known good input.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Unchecked malicious input may lead to integer overflows, injection based attacks, denial of service or information disclosure.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To check for this problem, use the following steps: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Find all input sources. </strong>During design time identify all of the potential input sources to your application. Scour the source code to discover sources of input that may have been missed in the design. Compile a list that you can use in the following steps. The most common sources are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>URL based parameters </li>
        <li>Form based parameters </li>
        <li>Hidden fields </li>
        <li>Cookies </li>
        <li>HTTP headers (Host, accept types, www authentication, cache settings, encodings, etc) </li>
        <li>Local filesystem </li>
        <li>Database </li>
        <li>Other services running on the system </li>
        <li>Javascript variables </li>
        <li>File upload and attributes (filename, size, data, etc) </li>
        <li>DNS results or host names </li>
        <li>External component call return values (COM, AJAX, ActiveX)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Trace data from source to sink. </strong>Trace each source of input through your application until you find its ultimate destination. The final sink may be in memory, on the hard drive, sent over the network or stored in a data store such as a database. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify validation routines. </strong>Each input source should have a data validation routine associated with it. Ideally the validation will occur as soon as the input reaches your application. Shared validation routines are better than creating many spread throughout your code base, so check for consolidation of routines to aid testing and reduce the chance of one-off bugs. If an input source does not have a validation routine associated with it, flag it for fixing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure quality of validation routines. </strong>Validation routines should check for length, range, format and type. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Validation routines should check for known good data and constrain input against each of those four categories. </li>
        <li>In web applications, look for application-supplied validators, such as a Custom Java Validator, to validate and constrain input after it is received from an input source. </li>
        <li>Ensure that all numeric fields are validated for type and range. Check for the use of regular expressions and <strong>java.util.regex</strong> or the use of a validator that checks numeric ranges by converting the input value to an integer or double and then performing a range check. </li>
        <li>Check that validators validate input against the least permissive expression possible that will accept all the input expected for that field. </li>
        <li>If you know that the field will have a certain internal structure, ensure that is checked for. </li>
        <li>If the input has an internal checksum, like a credit card number, ensure that is checked. <br /><br />Validation should check first for known valid, safe data and then for malicious, dangerous data. Do not rely on filtering out all malicious data, as it is too easy to miss something. Do not rely on client-side validation alone as it can be easily bypassed. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Input can vary in several ways: length, data type contents. It is recommended to verify that all of these meet your application's expectations regarding its input.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Validating length</strong>: Validating an input's length suggests that your application should check a string's length or the number of bits in a numeric value. Checking the length can help prevent buffer overflows as well as integer overflows in numeric values. A simple way of validating the numeric value can be done through the use of <em>BigInteger/BigDecimal</em>:<pre>public boolean validateLength(String input)<br />{<br />      if(validateType(input))<br />      {<br />            BigInteger bi = new BigInteger(input);<br /><br />            if(bi.compareTo(BigInteger.valueOf(0)) &gt; -1<br />               &amp;&amp; bi.compareTo(BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MAX_VALUE)) &lt; 1)<br />            {<br />                  return true;<br />            }<br />            else<br />            {<br />                  return false;<br />            }<br />      }<br />      else<br />      {<br />             return false;<br />      }<br />}</pre></li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Validating type</strong>: Validating the input's data type is important when your application expects a specific non-string parameter. Difference in data type can trigger unhandled exceptions that would throw your application into an unknown state. Example for validating numeric input:<pre>public boolean validateType(String input)<br />{<br />      String goodPattern = "\\d+";<br />      Pattern p = Pattern.compile(goodPattern);<br />      Matcher m = p.matcher(input);<br />            if(!m.matches())<br />      {<br /><br />            return false;<br />      }<br />      else<br />      {<br />            return true;<br />      }<br />}</pre></li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Validating contents</strong>: Validating the input's contents can be achieved using whitelist and blacklist techniques. The choice between the use of black and white listing is based upon the constraints that are imposed on the input. If the input follows a tight structure and format, then your application can use whitelisting alone to weed out malicious input. If there are unknowns about the input, then a combination of black and white listing must be used. In general, use blacklisting as a backup to whitelisting. Use a spiral-out approach as input is initially validated using whitelist techniques. When whitelisting cannot validate the input, fall back to blacklisting. If blacklist cannot validate, then discard the input. Whitelisting involves the establishment of what is good input to your application. Once good input is defined, your application must compare all input against the established good input. If the input does not resemble good input, your application should discard it. This technique can be implemented using regular expressions. Example:<pre>public boolean validateData(String input)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; String goodPattern = "(\\w|\\d)+";<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; int goodLength = 10;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if(input.length() &gt; goodLength)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return false;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Pattern p = Pattern.compile(goodPattern);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Matcher m = p.matcher(input);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if(!m.matches())<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return false;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; else<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return true;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />}</pre><p>Examples of useful regular expressions: </p><p /><table><tbody><tr><td>Use</td><td>Regular Expression</td><td>Java String</td></tr><tr><td>Valid E-Mail Address</td><td>^\w+(\.|_|-){0,1}\w+@(\w+\.)*\w{3,1024}\.([a-zA-Z]{2}\.){0,1}[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$</td><td>^\\w+(\\.|_|-){0,1}\\w+@(\\w+\\.)*\\w{3,}\\.([a-zA-Z]{2}\\.){0,1}[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$</td></tr><tr><td>Alpha-numeric free text</td><td>(\w|\d|\s|;|\?|!|,|\.|-|:)+</td><td>(\\w|\\d|\\s|;|\\?|!|,|\\.|-|:)+</td></tr><tr><td>Word characters</td><td>\w+</td><td>\\w+</td></tr><tr><td>Numbers</td><td>\d+</td><td>\\d+</td></tr></tbody></table><p /><ul></ul></li>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1><p>Input is validated on the server to ensure that it is in the expected format, based upon which contexts the input is used in, and encoded appropriately on output.</p><h1>Why</h1><p>An attacker passing malicious input can attempt SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other injection attacks that aim to exploit your vulnerabilities in your application. Validating input helps to reduce these risks by ensuring that the input received matches the expected format. Input validation on its own is not sufficient; output encoding is also needed to fully prevent these attacks as well as to improve&nbsp;reliability. Validation should always be as strict as possible, to ensure that problems do not arise from input thought to be out-of-range but harmless. An allow-list approach should always be taken, never a block list, to ensure that this property is maintained.</p><h1>How to Check</h1><p>To check for this problem, use the following steps: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Ensure&nbsp;that numeric range constraints have been enforced. </strong>Check that the <em>RangeValidator</em> control has been used to constrain the numeric input to a specific range.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ensure that verification fields are validated. </strong>Check that the <em>CompareValidator</em> control has been used to ensure validity for verification fields. An example of a verification field is the password entry field, where the user is required to re-type the value and the two values are compared to validate them. </p></li><li><p><strong>Ensure that type constraints have been enforced on string fields. </strong>Check that the <em>RegularExpressionValidator</em> control has been used to validate string input. This validator performs a variety of checks on string input fields using regular expressions. </p></li><li><p><strong>Ensure that custom validation has been used to handle remaining input constraints. </strong>Check that the <em>CustomValidator</em> control has been used to validate input for constraints not handled by the built-in ASP.NET validators. When the <strong>CustomValidator</strong> control is used, it is important to check that input has been validated for length, range, format and type. Use this validator in cases where your application might require certain business logic constraints which cannot be enforced by the existing validators for example. </p></li><li><p><strong>Ensure that the Regex class is being used to validate other sources. </strong>If you need to validate input from sources other than form fields, such as query string parameters or cookies, check that the <strong>Regex</strong> class, within the <strong>System.Text.RegularExpressions</strong> namespace, is being used. </p></li></ol><h1>Problem Example</h1><p>Consider a very simple form for an online shopping cart. The cart component consists of two components:</p><ol><li><p>An HTML form that contains all of the fields that make up the order to be submitted for processing:</p><pre>&lt;html&gt;<br>  &lt;head&gt;<br>    &lt;title&gt;Widget shopping cart&lt;/title&gt;<br>  &lt;/head&gt;<br>  &lt;body&gt;<br>    &lt;H1&gt;Welcome to the most boring shopping cart on the web!&lt;/H1&gt;<br>     A widget's current price is $19.95 USD. Please use the following form to submit an order.<br>    &lt;form action="process_order.aspx" method="POST"&gt;<br>       &lt;p&gt;Please enter the number of widgets you would like to purchase:&lt;/p&gt;<br>      quantity:&lt;br/&gt;<br>      &lt;select name="WidgetQuantity"&gt;<br>        &lt;option value="1"&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;<br>        &lt;option value="2"&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;<br>        &lt;option value="3"&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;<br>        &lt;option value="4"&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;<br>      &lt;/select&gt;<br>      ...<br>      &lt;input type="submit" value="order"/&gt;<br>    &lt;/form&gt;<br>  &lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;</pre></li><li><p>An ASP.NET page that processes the form submissions and performs the necessary steps to create the order.</p><pre>int dQuantity = Request("WidgetQuantity");<br>double dPrice = 19.95;<br>double dCost = dQuantity * dPrice;</pre></li></ol><p>This server side page is problematic because it lacks validation to ensure the quantity field is correct. The application works fine in the case where a user plays by the rules and submits the form as it is shown, because the quantity field ensures that the range constraints for the order quantity are always valid. However, if a clever user decides to construct their own form and submits a negative WidgetQuantity field, it causes a negative balance. Depending on what e-commerce system is used, this could result in a credit to the user's account. It also might subtract the negative balance from the company's inventory, which would carry significant ramifications and costs later on.</p><hr><p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance. </p>]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that SSL is used to protect authentication credentials and authentication cookies passed between browser and server.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>By using SSL, you make it much more difficult for an attacker to monitor the network connection&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;capture authentication credentials and authentication cookies to gain spoofed access to your application. </p>
  <p>SSL also can improve user trust in your application as it authenticates the server to the client, thus proving itself to be the end point for communications.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To ensure the forms authentication credentials and the forms authentication cookie is passed from browser to server with SSL, use the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Ensure that the authentication cookie is passed only over HTTPS connections. </li>
    <li>Ensure that the <strong>SSLOnly</strong> attribute is set&amp;nbsp;on all authentication and authorization cookies.&amp;nbsp; </li>
    <li>Ensure that all login forms, password change forms, role/authorization request, editing forms, or other authentication-required pages are only available over SSL and only accept submissions via SSL.&amp;nbsp; </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following tasks to assure that SSL is used to protect user credentials and authentication cookies:</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Restrict the authentication cookie to HTTPS connections. </strong>Cookies support a "secure" property that determines whether or not browsers should send the cookie back to the server. With the secure property set, the cookie is sent by the browser only to a secure page that is requested using an HTTPS URL.</p>
  <p>Set the secure property by using <strong>requireSSL="true"</strong> on the <strong>&lt;forms&gt;</strong> element as follows:</p>
  <pre>&lt;forms loginUrl="Secure\Login.aspx"<br />       requireSSL="true" . . . /&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    <strong>Encrypt the cookie and check its integrity. </strong>Encrypt the cookie and check its integrity, even if you are using SSL. This prevents an attacker from viewing or modifying the cookie if he or she manages to steal it through a XSS exploit, which would allow&amp;nbsp;the attacker&amp;nbsp;to still use the cookie to gain access to your application. The best way to mitigate this risk is to implement the appropriate countermeasures to prevent XSS attacks (described under "Cross-Site Scripting" earlier in this chapter), and limit the cookie lifetime as described in the next recommendation.</p>
  <p>To provide privacy and integrity for the cookie, set the <strong>protection</strong> attribute on the <strong>&lt;forms&gt;</strong> element as follows:</p>
  <pre>&lt;forms protection="All"    Privacy and integrity</pre>
  <p>A secure &lt;<strong>forms</strong>&gt; element configuration is shown here:</p>
  <pre>&lt;forms loginUrl="Secure\Login.aspx"<br />       protection="All"<br />       requireSSL="true"<br />       timeout="00:30:00"<br />       slidingExpiration="true"<br />       name="YourAppName"<br />       path="/Secure" /&gt;</pre>

  <p>Ensure that credentials are never sent via unencrypted connections. SSL should be used when transmitting credentials.</p>

  <p>Using SSL prevents the credentials from being sniffed or tampered with as they are transmitted over the network. If SSL is not used, user credentials may be compromised by attacks such as a Network Credential Sniffing Attack or a Phishing Attack. Additionally, use the Protect Session Cookies guideline to minimize the risk of exposing your application's session cookies to an attacker.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that a dedicated SSL enabled server is used for the authentication component of your application.</strong> Check that the server uses valid SSLv3 certificates that have been signed by a trusted certification authority. Ensure that your application's authentication component runs on a dedicated subdomain and a server that accepts only HTTPS traffic. Disallowing unencrypted HTTP connections will prevent accidental or malicious unsecured connections. Disallowing lower SSL versions, such as SSLv1 and SSLv2 will ensure that weaker encryption methods can not be exploited by an attacker.</p>
      <p>The following URL should connect and prompt for login credentials: </p>
      <pre>https://login.example.com/myapp/login.aspx</pre>
      <p>An HTTP URL to the same server and component should either be disallowed or redirect to its HTTPS counterpart:</p>
      <pre>http://login.example.com/myapp/login.aspx</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify forms that send credentials.</strong> Forms are defined by a &lt;form&gt; tag in the HTML document, such as the one below: </p>
      <pre>&lt;form method="POST" action="https://login.example.com/myapp/login.aspx"&gt;</pre>
      <p>Forms that include credentials usually, but won't always, include an input field with a TYPE attribute set to "password": </p>
      <pre>&lt;input <strong>type</strong>="<strong>password</strong>" name="pass" size=25&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure that form data is sent using HTTPS.</strong> Verify that the <strong>requireSSL</strong> attribute inside the &lt;forms&gt; element of your application's <strong>web.config</strong> is set to <strong>true</strong>:</p>
      <div>
        <br />
        <pre>&lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;<br />   &lt;forms loginUrl=https://login.example.com/myapp/login.aspx<br />           requireSSL="true"<br />           ... /&gt;<br />&lt;/authentication&gt;</pre>
        <br />
      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following snippet is part of an application's web.config. The application uses form based authentication and has configured its &lt;forms&gt; element accordingly. Unfortunately, the &lt;forms&gt; element does not have the requireSSL attribute set to true. Therefore the application fails to enforce the use of SSL when performing form-based authentication.</p>
  <pre>&lt;!-- The forms element does not have a requireSSL attribute --&gt;<br />&lt;forms loginUrl="Secure/Login.aspx"<br />       protection="All"<br />       timeout="00:30:00"<br />        slidingExpiration="true"<br />       name="MyApp"<br />       path="/Secure"<br /> /&gt;</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure all input is validated before it is passed to the database.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Unvalidated input can lead to persistent cross-site scripting, SQL injection and other vulnerabilities&amp;nbsp;that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Follow these steps to ensure that all input passed to database is validated:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all sources of input to the database. </strong>An application can have various sources of input. Each of these sources is an entry point to your application and can potentially be used to break your application's security model. Determine all sources of input&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;are eventually pushed to the database.</p>
      <p>Potential sources of input in a web application typically include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>URL based parameters </li>
        <li>Form based parameters </li>
        <li>Hidden fields </li>
        <li>Cookies </li>
        <li>HTTP headers </li>
        <li>Data stored on the local filesystem </li>
        <li>Database </li>
        <li>Other related services</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that validators have been used to check the input. </strong>Check that a content-specific validator has been placed at each entry point.<br />Each database input source should have a data validation routine associated with it. Ideally the validation will occur as soon as the input reaches your application. Shared validation routines are better than creating many spread throughout your code base, so check for consolidation of routines to aid testing. If a database input source does not have a validation routine associated with it, flag it for fixing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure that type-safe parameters and stored procedures are used. </strong>Check that stored procedures and parametrized queries have been implemented instead of using the input values directly in constructing dynamic SQL queries as the latter is prone to SQL injection. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure that database entry paths have been audited. </strong>Get a 3rd party reviewer to verify that all the database input paths have been identified and that validators have been correctly implemented for all entry points.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code validates the user based on a given username and password. It hashes the password with a random salt. Then it compares the username and the produced hash against the data stored in the backend database.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the SQL query is dynamically crafted by using the user's input. If there is no proper input validation, an attacker can access the application's database server through the use of SQL injection.</p>
  <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />      byte[] salt = MyApp.generateSalt();<br />      String passHash;<br />      SqlConnection cn;<br />      SqlCommand sqlCommand;<br />      String query;<br />      passHash = hashCredentials(pass, salt);<br />      // The application crafts the SQL query based on user's input<br />      cn = MyApp.getDBConnection();<br />      sqlCommand = new SqlCommand("select user from myappUsers where user = \"" + user + "\"<br />                                     + and pass = \"" + passHash + "\" and login_attempts &lt; 3;", cn);<br />      SqlDataReader reader = sqlCommand.ExecuteReader();<br />      updateLastLoginAttempt(user);<br />      ...<br />}</pre>
  <p>If a user submits a login request with a username of<i> 'foo\" or 1 = 1; drop table *; --',</i> the system will happily first authenticate the user and then drop all the tables in the database.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that your application validates all data that is passed between Java code and native code.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Unchecked input and/or output can lead to buffer overflows, injection based attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc., that exploit weaknesses in the application.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Due to the security risk posed by the use of native code, verify that your application validates data that is passed between native code and Java:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check if language boundaries are clearly defined. </strong>If your Java application needs to use native code, ensure that you have identified all the locations where the Java code interacts with native code. As your application moves between Java code and native code, special attention needs to be given to error handling routines, so that no security holes are introduced in your application by its native component.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify the quality of your application's validators. </strong>Verify that your application's data is properly validated for length, range, format and type.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that all data is validated. </strong>Verify that all data passing through the locations identified in Step 1 is validated.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure that data validation code is centralized. </strong>It is better that all validation routines in your application are centralized for cleaner and better control. Shared validation routines are better than creating many routines spread throughout your application's code base. Every time your application accepts external data as input, it should first pass through this set of validation routines.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>There are several things to consider when validating input/output between native and Java code: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check language barriers. </strong>Distinguishing&amp;nbsp;the boundaries between native and Java code is very important. Because the Java sandbox provides multiple security checks to its code, it is important to know the boundary&amp;nbsp;between&amp;nbsp;where the Java sandbox ends and the compiled code begins&amp;nbsp;to interact&amp;nbsp;directly with the CPU, so you can&amp;nbsp;compensate for&amp;nbsp;the lack of such checks inside the native code.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Validate for length, range, format and type. </strong>After discovering the language boundaries, determine the type, format and structure of the data that is passed between Java and native code. Build a validator for each type of data that is passed between the two environments. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Construct a set of validators. </strong>Centralize your application's validators as it helps strengthen the code by limiting the amount of scattered validation code throughout your application. Place the set of validators on the language barriers. Your application should pass data between native and Java code only through its set of validators.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment shows JNI code that utilizes a COM object. Making the assumption that the Java code will handle data validation, the JNI segment does not verify that the passed input is a valid GUID. Since invalid GUIDs may cause unhandled exceptions, an attacker can force the application to disclose its call stack and possibly its source filenames.</p>
  <pre>#include &lt;jni.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;atlbase.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;windows.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;wtypes.h&gt;<br />JNIEXPORT jboolean<br />JNICALL Java_Identifier_invokeObject<br />      (JNIEnv * env, jobject jobj, jstring jguid)<br />{<br />      HRESULT result;<br />      CLSID clsid;<br />      IUnknown *pIunkn;<br />      LPWSTR guid;<br />      jboolean iscopy;<br />      jboolean ret = false;<br />      char* temp_guid = (*env)-&gt;GetStringUTFChars(env, jguid, &amp;iscopy);<br />      //The application fails to verify that the GUID is valid<br />      guid = SysAllocStringLen(0, 38);<br />      MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, temp_guid, -1, guid, 38);<br />      result = GUIDFromString(guid, &amp;clsid);<br />      ...<br />      return ret;<br />}</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment shows a JNI code that utilizes a COM object. Because the passed input is accepted only if it is a GUID, the application reduces the risk of unhandled exceptions.</p>
  <pre>#include &lt;jni.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;atlbase.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;windows.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;wtypes.h&gt;  <br />JNIEXPORT jboolean <br />JNICALL Java_Identifier_invokeObject<br />      (JNIEnv * env, jobject jobj, jstring jguid)<br />{<br />      HRESULT result;<br />      CLSID clsid;<br />      IUnknown *pIunkn;<br />      LPWSTR guid;<br />      jboolean iscopy;<br />      jboolean ret = false;<br />      char* temp_guid = (*env)-&gt;GetStringUTFChars(env, jguid, &amp;iscopy);<br />      // The application verifies that the input matches the criteria for a GUID<br />      if(!validGUID(temp_guid))<br />      {<br />            return ret;<br />      }<br />      guid = SysAllocStringLen(0, 38);<br />      MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, temp_guid, -1, guid, 38);<br />      result = GUIDFromString(guid, &amp;clsid);<br />       ...<br />      return ret;<br />}<br /><br />bool validGUID(char *guid)<br />{<br />      // Check that GUID is of right length<br />      if(strlen(guid) != 38) return false;<br />      // Sample GUID: {1EF4A023-143A-4e0e-AD72-69C2C68C2D70<br />}<br />      if(guid[0]  != '{') return false;<br />      if(guid[9]  != '-') return false;<br />      if(guid[14] != '-') return false;<br />      if(guid[19] != '-') return false;<br />      if(guid[24] != '-') return false;<br />      if(guid[37] != '}') return false;<br />      int i=1;<br />      while(i&lt;37)<br />      {<br />            if((guid[i] &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; guid[i] &lt;= 'f')<br />                  || (guid[i] &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; guid[i] &lt;= 'F')<br />                  || (guid[i] &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; guid[i] &lt;= '9')<br />            {<br />                  // GUID is valid<br />            }<br />            else<br />            {<br />                  return false;<br />            }<br />            i++;<br />            if(i == 9 || i == 14 || i == 19 || i == 24)<br />            {<br />                  i++;<br />            }<br />      }<br /><br />      return true;<br />}</pre>

  <p>Unauthorized access to the credential store can lead to users' credentials being overwritten; therefore, allowing the attacker to gain access to application resources without obtaining valid credentials.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Follow these steps to ensure that the credential store is properly secured: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all routines that access the store. </strong>Locate all routines within your application that access the credential store. Such routines include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Authenticating users </li>
        <li>Creating users </li>
        <li>Modifying users </li>
        <li>Changing user passwords</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that credentials for accessing the store are secured. </strong>Ensure that your application's access credentials and connection strings are not hard-coded into your application's code base. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If your application <strong>uses a database</strong> as its credential repository, ensure that access credentials and connection strings are secured properly. </li>
        <li>If your application <strong>does not use a database</strong> for its credential repository, verify that only the appropriate components of your application are able to access the credential store.<br /><br />Example of how <strong>not</strong> to handle access to the credential store: </li>
      </ul>
      <p />
      <blockquote>
        <pre>// The application discloses the credentials necessary for accessing the user database<br />DriverManager.registerDriver(new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver());<br />Connection cn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@testbox:1521:orcl2", "myapp", "pass"); </pre>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check the access controls for your credential store.</strong> Ensure that your application's credential store has the appropriate security in place. For instance, if your application uses a database for its credential store, verify that the database server is secured properly.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Follow these steps to limit the access to the credential store: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Avoid disclosing the location of the store. </strong>Do not disclose the location of the store within your application. Do not let&amp;nbsp;regular application users know where the store is located. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Secure credentials required for accessing the store. </strong>Store your credentials within a configuration file and encrypt them. Place the encryption key within a keystore that is encrypted using a local account password.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Restrict access to repository. </strong>Limit the number of users that can access the store. If it is a file on the local file system, set the appropriate permissions to restrict the read/write access. If it is a database, restrict the accounts that can access the database server.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code authenticates a user based on their credentials. Because the code discloses the credentials to the user database, anybody with access to the code also has access to the credential store. </p>
  <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />      boolean valid;<br />      Connection cn;<br /><br />      // Prepare credentials before querying the credential store<br />      ...<br />      try<br />      {<br />            // The application discloses the credentials necessary for<br />            // accessing the user database<br />            DriverManager.registerDriver(new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver());<br />            cn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@testbox:1521:orcl2",<br />                                             "myapp", "pass");<br />            // Query the credential store and perform the rest<br />            // of the authentication steps<br />            ...<br />      }<br />      catch (SQLException se)<br />      {<br />            // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms<br />            return false;<br />      }<br /><br />      return valid;<br />}</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code authenticates a user based on their credentials. The code relies on other parts of the application to handle database connectivity. Therefore, the code does not reveal the application's credentials to the credential store. </p>
  <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />      boolean valid;<br />      // Prepare credentials before querying the credential store<br />      ...<br />      try<br />      {<br />            // The credentials to the application's user database<br />            // are not hard-coded in the authentication routine<br />            cn = MyApp.getDBConnection();<br />            // Query the credential store and perform the rest<br />            // of the authentication steps<br />            ...<br />      }<br />      catch (SQLException se)<br />      {<br />            // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms<br />            return false;<br />      }<br />      return valid;<br />}</pre>]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that there is a boundary defined to separate public and restricted content in both the URL namespace and file system namespace. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Defining a boundary between public and restricted content simplifies the task of user authorization and is generally less prone to error. When the content is separated, server configuration can be used to automatically apply authorization rules without relying on the developer to explicitly add checks in the code.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Take the following steps to ensure your application is partitioned into public and restricted domains:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enumerate all web accessible resources.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Identify the protected resources from the public resources. Common protected resources include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Resources that require authentication </li>
        <li>Critical application resources </li>
        <li>Sensitive/confidential data</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check the structure of the URL namespace.</strong> Ensure that your application's URL namespace is structured properly according to the level of protection and security needs of each resource. Verify that transitions between URL namespaces is performed using absolute URLs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check if there is separation on disk between public and protected resources. </strong>Examine the local filesystem structure. Ensure that protected resources are not located inside a public directory and vice versa. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure that protected resources have the appropriate access controls.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Determine if all protected resources have the appropriate access controls assigned to them.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify the local system permissions for all resources.</strong> For each resource, check that the local filesystem permissions are set accordingly. If the resource is public, verify that anonymous users can access it. If the resource is protected, verify that only authorized users can access it.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>MyApp is a financial tool that generates reports based on sensitive data. It allows the user to upload the financial data and download the report. Since the application is small, all of its content is located within the same directory. The access control is enforced by the web application through checking the required permissions before a given call is executed.</p>
  <p>Since both data and code are within the same directory, it may be possible for an attacker to gain access to the raw financial data.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that application keys are stored in a well defined location, such as the encrypted sections of the application's <i>web.config</i> or encrypted in the Windows Registry. Verify that they are not hard coded into the application or stored as plaintext inside configuration files.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>When faced with encryption, intruders attack the most vulnerable aspect: key management. Because keys are used to encrypt sensitive data, the keys themselves become sensitive data that need to be protected. </p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to verify a secure key storage location is used.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the mechanism used for handling encryption keys.</strong> The mechanism used should be either the Windows Registry or the application's web.config file. Ensure that your application is using the most appropriate mechanism. If the storage locations for keys are not properly documented, look for encryption functions in the code and trace the key material back to see where it is stored, both temporarily and permanently. If you do have documentation, check that the code conforms to the documentation. When tracing through code, ensure that you look at the entire lifetime of the key in the system; keys may be written out insecurely after they are used, even if the path from a secure initial source to use is correct.</p>
      <p>If you store your application's encryption keys into the Windows Registry, ensure that DPAPI is used to protect them. The following code gives an example of how this can be done:</p>
      <pre>encKey = ProtectedData.Protect(encKey, salt, DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser);<br />RegistryKey rk = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey("SOFTWARE\\MyApp\\KeyStore", true);<br />rk.SetValue("encKey", wBuff, RegistryValueKind.Binary);</pre>
      <p>If you store your application's encryption keys in web.config, ensure that they are stored into the <strong>appSettings</strong> section. Use the <strong>aspnet_regiis</strong> utility to check that the <strong>appSettings</strong> section is encrypted. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure the key store is protected.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Ensure that either DPAPI or ASP.NET protected configuration files are being used.&amp;nbsp;Verify that the appropriate permissions are set on the configuration files and registry keys so they can be only accessed by your application and its administrators.&amp;nbsp;Verify that only the application and its administrators can access the IIS metabase.&amp;nbsp;Access to the metabase is controlled with ACLs, similar to normal files or registry keys. Verify that only authorized accounts are listed in the <i>BUILTIN\Administrators</i> group and that other ACLs are properly set up.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify the application securely handles keys.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Ensure that keys are not hard coded into the source code. When tracing back from an encryption or signing operation, if you see private key material included literally in the body of an application's source code, you have&amp;nbsp;found a hard-coded key&amp;nbsp;that needs to be moved to a protected keystore.&amp;nbsp;Ensure that keys are not placed into unprotected configuration files. If a private key is read from a configuration file and the<i> aspnet_regiis</i> utility (or manual inspection) show that it is not encrypted, the key needs to be moved to a protected key store.&amp;nbsp;Ensure that keys are unloaded from memory after use. If keys are left in memory instead of being cleared out when no longer needed, or if they are written to any form of temporary storage without protection, they are vulnerable to theft from memory or the temporary storage location.&amp;nbsp;</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that the account administration interface is separate from the main application interface.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Account administration requires higher privileges than the main application interface. Separating the two interfaces decreases the risk of a normal user being able to escalate privileges to that of an administrator.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to verify that the&amp;nbsp;account administration interface is separate from the main application interface: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that your application has a separate administrative interface. </strong>Review your application's design and verify that your application's design specifies separation of administrative and main application interfaces. Verify that your application passes the following checks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Administrative Functionality</strong>: Verify that all administrative functionality is clearly identified and separated from the rest of your application's functionality. Exceptions are allowed only when your application allows users to modify their own accounts. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Code Organization</strong>: Ensure all administrative functionality is structured as a single module and not scattered throughout your application. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Code Inheritance</strong>: Verify that all Java classes that handle your application's administrative tasks are declared as final. Example: <p /><blockquote><pre>public final class myappAcctAdmin<br />{<br /> ...<br />}</pre></blockquote></li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hosting Container</strong>: Verify that all administrative functionality operates within a Java container or a JVM that is separate from the rest of your application. Depending on the application server that your application uses, it might be necessary to run multiple instances of the application server. Additionally, check if your administrative interface operates on a different port than the rest of your application (e.g. port 3128).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure that the administrative interface is secure. </strong>Use the following steps to examine the security of your application's administrative interface:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Security Policy</strong>: Ensure that your application has a security policy regarding its administrative interface. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Separate Authentication</strong>: Verify that privileged users are forced to re-authenticate before accessing the administrative interface. Check if your application's administrative interface uses a separate authentication module&amp;nbsp;from the rest of your application. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access Controls</strong>: Verify that only valid, privileged users can access your application's administrative interface. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Connection</strong>: Depending on your application's requirements, it may be necessary to check if your application's administrative interface is accessed over SSL. Ensure your application's proper use of SSL.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps when designing an administrative interface:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Only privileged users can administer all accounts. </strong>Design your application such that the administrative module is separate from the main application interface. Since the separation requires using separate authentication mechanisms for the application and its administration, there is a reduced risk&amp;nbsp;of escalation-of-privilege attacks. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Users may be allowed to administer their own accounts. </strong>It may be necessary to allow users to administer their own accounts. This involves the ability to change passwords, account details, etc. Such administration can be done through the main application interface. Because the user is modifying sensitive data, extra security precautions must be enforced:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Session management implemented in server side code</b>: The user should always be tracked at the server-side. Store the userID inside a session. The only data the client needs to know is the session identifier. This reduces the risk of an attacker modifying another user's account information. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Force re-authentication</strong>: Enforce re-authentication when modifying the user's password. This helps verify that the user is aware of the password change and is not a victim of a session hijacking.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Modify accounts in sections</strong>: Do not modify all account information at once. For example, group the account information into credentials, personal data, contact information and additional information. Modifying the account information in groups reduces the risk of information leakage when the user is updating his/her account. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use SSL when modifying&amp;nbsp;accounts</strong>: If SSL is implemented correctly, it can verify the authenticity of the application. It can also encrypt traffic and hence provide confidentiality.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that redirects and forwards are not used unless necessary.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Redirects or forwards may be manipulated by an attacker to create hyperlinks that appear to point to legitimate sites, but actually point to attacker-controlled malicious pages. This technique is oftened used by phishers to trick people into trusting a fake web site.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to verify that redirects and forwards are not used unless necessary:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Review application design.</strong> Look through project documentation for any mentions of redirects or forwards (also known as transfers in .NET). Ideally, there should be no redirects or forwards in the application design.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Review code.</strong> Search code for redirects or forwards. Because there are many different ways to implement redirects and forwards, look through every page for code that handles parameters, and verify that this code doesn't perform redirects or forwards based on input.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to avoid using redirects or forwards:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enumerate redirects and forwards.</strong> Review application code to find all redirects and forwards used by the application.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Review application design.</strong> Determine how redirects and forwards figure into the application design. Consider making design changes to remove the need for redirects and forwards.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Remove redirects or forwards.</strong> Remove the redirects and forwards that are not necessary after changes to the application design.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Secure the remaining redirects or forwards.</strong> If there appears to be no reasonable way to get rid of redirects or forwards, use related guidelines to secure the remaining redirects or forwards.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>Consider an on-line banking application that has an insecure redirect:</p>
  <pre>http://www.onlinebank.com/redirect.asp?url=[destination]</pre>
  <p>A phisher may create the following hyperlink to point to his own site and send it in spam messages to millions of people:</p>
  <pre>http://www.onlinebank.com/redirect.asp?url=www.phisher.com</pre>
  <p>When a user sees a link that appears to point to his bank at onlinebank.com in an e-mail message, he clicks that link and sees a web site that looks exactly like the bank's, but is actually a phishing web site used to steal authentication credentials. The user enters his account number and PIN into the web page, receives an error message telling him to try again, and is redirected to the bank's real site. After entering his credentials again, the user successfuly views his account. However, the phisher now has the user's online banking information.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The best solution to unvalidated redirects or forwards is to not use redirects or forwards at all. Considering the problem example above, a simple solution would be to remove the redirect.asp page after making the necessary changes to the application design.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>If your user's accounts are in Active Directory,&amp;nbsp;verify that&amp;nbsp;your application is using Windows Authentication.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>By using Windows authentication with Active Directory, you benefit from a unified identity store, centralized account administration, enforceable account and password policies and strong authentication that avoids sending plain-text passwords over the network. </p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check if your application is using Windows Authentication:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <div>Check if your user accounts are stored in Active Directory.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>Ensure that IIS is set to disable anonymous access.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>Ensure that IIS is configured to use Windows-based authentication for your web application's virtual directory.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>Ensure&amp;nbsp;that the <strong>mode</strong> attribute on the &lt;<strong>authentication</strong>&gt; element is set to "Windows" (the default setting) in your Web.config file.</div>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To use Windows authentication in ASP.NET, you must use Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) to disable anonymous access and configure a Windows-based authentication method for your Web application's virtual directory. You are generally recommended to use Windows integrated authentication, but you can also use Basic, Digest, or client certificate authentication. You must also ensure that the <strong>mode</strong> attribute on the &lt;<strong>authentication</strong>&gt; element is set to "Windows" (the default setting) in your Web.config file. </p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that the confidentiality of session cookies is protected.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Session cookies are used by an application to identify the session associated with a particular user. Protecting session cookies can help prevent an attacker from hijacking the session and using the application posing as a legitimate user.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to verify that your application's session cookies are handled securely:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that session identifiers cannot be guessed. </strong>Ensure that your application's session identifiers cannot be guessed by an attacker. Verify that your application's session IDs meet the following requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Length</strong>: Your application uses long session identifiers (e.g. string of length 32). </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Triviality</strong>: Your application uses randomly generated session identifiers. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lifetime</strong>: Your application uses <em>HttpSession.setMaxInactiveInterval</em> to expire inactive <span>sessions or that the timeout has been set via a configuration in web.xml.</span></li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recycling</strong>: Your application does not reuse previously used sessions.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that users can invalidate their own sessions. </strong>Ensure that your application uses <em>HttpSession.invalidate</em> to allow its users to invalidate their own sessions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that session cookies are sent over encrypted channels. </strong>Ensure your application transmits session cookies over encrypted channels. Although this is not required for non-sensitive transactions, it is mandatory for any transactions that are sensitive in nature.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <p>
          <strong>Verify that session cookies have the <em>HttpOnly</em> flag set</strong>. This prevents client side scripts from gaining access to the cookie.</p>
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <p>
          <strong>Verify that session cookies have the <em>Secure</em> flag set.</strong> The <em>Secure</em>&amp;nbsp;flag forces sessions cookies to be sent only over SSL.</p>
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <span>
          <p>
            <strong>Verify that sessions are invalidated on login</strong>. This can help prevent session fixation (or hijacking).</p>
        </span>
      </span>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to secure session cookies:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Do not allow users to choose their own session identifiers. </strong>Java automatically assigns random IDs to its sessions which minimizes the risk of an attacker hijacking another user's session by using the same session ID. To use sessions in Java, invoke <em>HttpServletRequest.getSession</em>:</p>
      <pre>HttpSession session = request.getSession();</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <p>
          <strong>Invalidate the session identifier on login (as well as logout) to ensure session identifiers are not reused.</strong> This is a portion of the approach necessary to prevent session hijacking. Use <em>HttpSession.invalidate</em> to accomplish this. After the session has been invalidated, the call below will generate a new session identifier.</p>
      </span>
      <pre>HttpSession session = request.getSession(true);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Time-out sessions. </strong>
      <span>Set an expiration time for sessions. This helps minimize the threat of session hijacking by giving an attacker a smaller window of opportunity. Depending on your application, an appropriate timeout can be anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes. Setting when sessions should expire can be done through <em>HttpSession.setMaxInactiveInterval</em> in code, or via the <em>session-timeout</em> configuration in the web.xml file.<p /></span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Allow users to terminate their sessions. </strong>Allowing users to invalidate their sessions reduces the risk of session being hijacked. Use <em>HttpSession.invalidate</em> to accomplish this.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Ensure cookies are sent over encrypted channels. </strong>
      <span>Mark cookies sent over SSL as <em>Secure</em>. Use <em>Cookie.setSecure</em> to require SSL when sending out the given cookie. It is recommended to avoid sending session cookies over unencrypted channels as session hijacking is made much easier. Use <em>ServletRequest.isSecure</em> to verify whether SSL is being used.&amp;nbsp;There is a cookie-secure attribute that can be set for the session id cookie in the web.xml file.<p /></span>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> PCI DSS requirements state that sessions that are idle for 15 minutes should be locked automatically and require the user's password to unlock.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code shows the logout function of the <em>LoginModule</em> used when relying on JAAS for authentication. The code removes all authentication tokens associated with the current session but fails to invalidate the session. </p>
  <pre>public boolean logout() throws LoginException{<br />      subject.getPrincipals().remove(userToken);<br /><br />      clearCredentials();<br />      userToken = null;<br /><br />      // The application should have invalidated the session here.<br />      // Log the logout event. Consult the Logging section for more details<br />      return true;<br />}</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code shows the logout function of the <em>LoginModule</em> used when relying on JAAS for authentication. The code removes all authentication tokens associated with the current session and invalidates the session.</p>
  <pre>public boolean logout() throws LoginException{<br />      subject.getPrincipals().remove(userToken);<br /><br />      clearCredentials();<br />      userToken = null;<br /><br />      // The application invalidates the session when<br />      // the user is logging out<br />      HttpSession session = common.getCurrentSession();<br />      session.invalidate();<br /><br />      // Log the logout event. Consult the Logging section for more details<br />      return true;<br />}</pre>

  <p>Ensure that your application uses RSA Protected Configuration provider to&amp;nbsp;protect connection strings in a Web farm environment.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To protect credentials in configuration files, encrypt them. Place your database connection strings inside the &lt;<strong>connectionStrings</strong>&gt; element of the Web.config file and then encrypt that element by using the Aspnet_regiis utility. You can use DPAPI or RSA encryption. Use RSA in Web farms because you can easily export and import RSA keys across servers. Protecting connection strings is particularly important for connection strings that use SQL authentication because they contain clear text user IDs and passwords.</p>
  <strong>Note:</strong>&amp;nbsp;You should also encrypt connection strings if you use Windows authentication. Although this form of connection string does not contain credentials, you should aim to keep server and database names private. <hr /><p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance. </p>]]></Data>

  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>You must log failed logon attempts to be able to detect and trace suspicious behavior.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>To audit failed logon attempts</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start the Local Security Policy tool from the Administrative Tools program group.
</li>
    <li>Expand <strong>Local Policies</strong> and then select <strong>Audit Policy</strong></li>
    <li>Double-click <strong>Audit account logon events</strong>. </li>
    <li>Click <strong>Failure</strong> and then <strong>OK</strong>. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Logon failures are recorded as events in the Windows security event log. The following event IDs are suspicious:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>531</strong>. This means an attempt was made to log on using a disabled account.
</li>
    <li>
      <strong>529</strong>. This means an attempt was made to log on using an unknown user account or using a valid user account but with an invalid password. An unexpected increase in the number of these audit events might indicate an attempt to guess passwords.

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that mapping values are used to determine destinations of redirects and forwards.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using mapping values when performing redirects or forwards prevents malicious users from creating hyperlinks that use the redirects or forwards to point to pages other than those intended by the application design.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to make sure that mapping values are used for redirects and forwards:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify redirects and forwards.</strong> Review code to find all redirects and forwards.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Examine redirects and forwards.</strong> Look for code that handles parameters. Verify that this code does not accept fully qualified URLs as input for calculating destinations of redirects or forwards. If the code uses parameters to calculate destinations of redirects or forwards, verify that only short-hand keywords defined by the application are accepted as input to map to valid and authorized destinations.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to calculate destinations of redirects and forwards based on mapping values:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify redirects and forwards.</strong> Review code to find all redirects and forwards.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enumerate destinations.</strong> Make a list of all destinations pointed to by redirects and forwards.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define mapping values.</strong> Define mapping values for all destinations used by redirects and forwards. A mapping value is a short identifying string that symbolically represents a resource.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Rewrite redirects and forwards.</strong> Rewrite redirects and forwards to use mapping values as input to calculate the final destinations of redirects or forwards.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>Consider an on-line banking application that has an insecure redirect:</p>
  <pre>http://www.onlinebank.com/redirect.asp?url=[destination]</pre>
  <p>A phisher may create the following hyperlink to point to his own site and send it in spam messages to millions of people:</p>
  <pre>http://www.onlinebank.com/redirect.asp?url=www.phisher.com</pre>
  <p>When a user sees a link that appears to point to his bank at onlinebank.com in an e-mail message, he clicks that link and sees a web site that looks exactly like the bank's, but is actually a phishing web site used to steal authentication credentials. The user enters his account number and PIN into the web page, receives an error message telling him to try again, and is redirected to the bank's real site. After entering his credentials again, the user successfuly views his account. However, the phisher now has the user's online banking information.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The simplest solution&amp;nbsp;is to get rid of the redirect altogether, but if it is necessary for application design, then mapping values may be used to mitigate this vulnerability. For example, if redirect.asp is used by the application to redirect to balance.asp, a mapping value called "balance" may be created to signify balance.asp. The page redirect.asp should then be rewritten to accept mapping values as input, instead of urls. The following url should then redirect to balance.asp:</p>
  <pre>http://www.onlinebank.com/redirect.asp?map=balance</pre>
  <p>However, the following malicious hyperlink will no longer work, because supplied input will not match any mapping value defined in the application:</p>
  <pre>http://www.onlinebank.com/redirect.asp?url=www.phisher.com</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that encryption is used to protect all&amp;nbsp;sensitive data transmitted over the network.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Because network traffic can be easily eavesdropped or modified by attackers, passing sensitive data over the network is prone to a host of attacks, including data theft and data manipulation.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>When an application transmits sensitive data over the network, it is necessary to ensure that it is encrypted to protect the data from being&amp;nbsp;read or modified in transit. To ensure this, follow the steps outlined below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Search for hyperlinks leading to non-SSL resources.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Review application code and look for hyperlinks starting with "http://" - such hyperlinks lead to resources, which are not secured by SSL. Make sure that non-SSL hyperlinks&amp;nbsp;are not used to navigate between&amp;nbsp;pages that handle sensitive data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive information. </strong>Sensitive data is any information that is kept secret and should be disclosed only to authorized parties. Common examples of sensitive data include, but are not limited to, names of customers, government issued ID numbers, credit card and other financial information, passwords and private keys. Some industries, such as health care and banking, have regulatory standards that define sensitive information. Use regulatory requirements, as they apply to your application, to identify sensitive data. Sensitive data can be defined as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information that either contains personally identifiable information or can be used to derive personally identifiable information that should not be shared with others. </li>
        <li>Information that a user provides that they would not want shared with other users of the application. </li>
        <li>Information that comes from an external trusted source that is not designed to be shared with users</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>
      </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that sensitive data is securely transmitted. </strong>Ensure that your application transmits sensitive data in a secured fashion.&amp;nbsp;Verify that&amp;nbsp;your application&amp;nbsp;encrypts the data using&amp;nbsp;encryption or hashing and encrypts the communication link:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Encrypting application data:</strong> Your application securely transforms its application data before transmitting it over the network:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Hashing: </strong>Hashing is a one-way mechanism for protecting sensitive data in a non-retrievable way. If your application uses hashing as a means for protecting sensitive data, verify that the following pieces are in place:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Salt</strong>: Your application generates its salt using the SecureRandom class. </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Function</strong>: Your application uses SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512 as its hash function. </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Invocation</strong>: Your application invokes the <em>Cipher.doFinal</em> method to perform the hashing procedure. </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Clean-up</strong>: Your application securely cleans-up all instances of the sensitive data after the hashing procedure has been completed. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Encryption:</strong> Encryption is a mechanism for protecting sensitive data in a retrievable way. If your application uses encryption as a means for protecting sensitive data, verify that the following pieces are in place:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Encryption Key</strong>: Your application's encryption keys are securely stored inside your application's key store.&amp;nbsp; </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Function</strong>: Your application uses AES, 3DES, or any other strong symmetric encryption function. </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Invocation</strong>: Your application invokes the <em>Cipher.init</em> and <em>Cipher.doFinal</em> methods to perform the encryption procedure. </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Clean-up</strong>: Your application securely cleans-up all instances of the sensitive data and their encryption keys after the encryption procedure has been completed. </li>
              </ul>

        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to protect sensitive data over the network:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive information. </strong>Sensitive data is any information that is kept secret and should be disclosed only to authorized parties. Common examples of sensitive data include, but are not limited to, names of customers, government issued ID numbers, credit card and other financial information, passwords and private keys. Some industries, such as health care and banking, have regulatory standards that define sensitive information. Use regulatory requirements, as they apply to your application, to identify sensitive data. Sensitive data can be defined as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information that either contains personally identifiable information or can be used to derive personally identifiable information that should not be shared with others. </li>
        <li>Information that a user provides that they would not want shared with other users of the application. </li>
        <li>Information that comes from an external trusted source that is not designed to be shared with users.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose an appropriate protection mechanism. </strong>Choosing the appropriate protection mechanism may depend on various conditions: purpose of the sensitive data, role of the other network party, infrastructure and supported technologies. Because sensitive data must be encrypted when in transit, there are two strategies, to encrypt the communication channel or to encrypt the application data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Encrypt the communication channel</strong>: Depending on the current infrastructure and the other network party, it is possible to encrypt the connections using Java's crypto library or any technologies supported by the remote party.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Encrypt the application data</strong>: If your application's communication channels cannot be encrypted, encrypt the application data. Hashing or encryption should be used when protecting the application data. Use hashing if the application data will be used only for comparison purposes. Use encryption if the application data will be retrieved at a later stage.</p>
          <p>If hashing is used, choose a longer salt, 16 or more bits.&amp;nbsp;In the case&amp;nbsp;that the produced hash is compromised, longer salts make it more difficult for an attacker to gain access to the sensitive data. If your application uses randomly generated salt, make sure that your application encrypts the random salt and stores it in a configuration file. Always use <strong>SecureRandom</strong> and not <strong>Random</strong> to generate the salt. Example of using <strong>SecureRandom</strong> to generate a random salt:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <pre>public static byte[] generateSalt() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException<br />{<br />      // Note that salt is declared as private static byte[] and is<br />      // initialized to null.<br />      if (salt == null)<br />      {<br />            SecureRandom srand = SecureRandom.getInstance("SHA1PRNG");<br />                          salt = new byte[4];<br />            srand.nextBytes(salt);<br />      }<br />       return salt;<br />}</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Choosing a strong hashing algorithm is also important. Stronger algorithms prevent multiple unique pieces of data from producing identical hash values. The current recommendation is to use SHA-256 or stronger.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <pre>public String hashCredentials(char[] pass, byte[] salt)<br />      throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException<br />{<br />      MessageDigest md;<br />      byte[] tempPass;<br />      byte[] digest;<br />            md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-512");<br />      //Convert char[] to byte[]<br />      tempPass = new byte[pass.length];<br />      for (int i = 0; i &lt; pass.length; i++)<br />      {<br />            tempPass[i] = (byte)pass[i];<br />      }<br />      md.update(tempPass);<br />      md.update(salt);<br />      digest = md.digest();<br />      md.reset();<br />      //Clean tempPass<br />      for (int i = 0; i &lt; tempPass.length; i++)<br />      {<br />            tempPass[i] = 0;<br />      }<br />       return new String(digest);<br />}</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Use encryption if the application data will be retrieved at a later stage.<br /><br />Use symmetric encryption if and only if your application is the only entity that will access the encrypted data. Use a key size of 256-bit or higher and AES for symmetric encryption.<br /><br />Use public/private key encryption if the data will be accessed by two or more parties. Use a key size of 2048-bit or higher and RSA for public/private key encryption. Public/private key encryption allows your application to share sensitive data with multiple entities without disclosing its own encryption key.</p>
          <pre>// Because the following code generates a new encryption key,<br />// make sure to store it into the application's keystore.<br />KeyGenerator kgen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");<br />kgen.init(256);<br />SecretKey skey = kgen.generateKey();<br />// Set up cipherCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");<br />cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, skey);<br />// Note that sensitiveData is of type byte[] and contains<br />// data that is sensitive in naturebyte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(sensitiveData);</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Apply the appropriate protection mechanism</strong>. Evaluate the code and determine the places where sensitive data is transmitted. Apply the established protection mechanism at each location.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>try<br />{<br />      // The application produces a hash based on the sensitive data<br />      userEmail = MyApp.getEmailForUser(user);<br />      passDigest = encryptCredentials(userEmail, pass, salt);<br />}<br />catch (GeneralSecurityException gse)<br />{<br />      // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms<br />      return false;}catch (IOException ioe)<br />{<br />      // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms<br />      return false;<br />}<br />// The application stores the hashed sensitive data into the database<br />Connection cn = MyApp.getDBConnection();<br />PreparedStatement st = cn.prepareStatement("select login_attempts from myappUsers"<br />                                        + " where user = ? and pass = ?;");<br />st.setString(1, user);<br />st.setBytes(2, passDigest);<br />ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery();</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> PCI DSS requirements state that all sensitive data must be encrypted before being sent over the network or be sent over an encrypted channel.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code authenticates a user based on a username and password. The supplied credentials are compared to the credentials stored in the backend database. Unfortunately, the credentials are transmitted in plaintext and could be stolen if the network is compromised.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />      // Query the credential store with the provided credentials<br />      ...<br />}</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code validates the user based on&amp;nbsp;a given username and password. It uses the user's valid email address and a random salt to encrypt the user's password before comparing&amp;nbsp;the username and the produced digest against the data stored in the backend database. Therefore, the password is encrypted before being transmitted over the network and is protected from being compromised.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />       ...<br />       // Encrypt the credentials<br />      try<br />      {<br />            userEmail = MyApp.getEmailForUser(user);<br />            passDigest = encryptCredentials(userEmail, pass, salt);<br />      }<br />      catch (GeneralSecurityException gse)<br />      {<br />            // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms<br />            return false;<br />      }<br />     catch (IOException ioe)<br />      {<br />            // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms<br />            return false;<br />      }<br />       // Query the credential store and execute the rest of the authentication steps<br />      ...<br />}<br />public static byte[] encryptCredentials(String email, char[] pass, byte[] salt)<br />      throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException<br />{<br />      MessageDigest md; <br />      byte[] tempPass;<br />      byte[] rawKey;<br />      // Generate encryption key<br />      md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-512");<br />      md.update(email.getBytes("UTF-8"));<br />      md.update(salt);<br />      rawKey = md.digest();<br />      md.reset();<br />      SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(rawKey, "AES");<br />      // Set up cipher<br />      Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");<br />      cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, skeySpec);<br />      // Convert char[] to byte[]<br />      tempPass = new byte[pass.length];<br />      for (int i = 0; i &lt; pass.length; i++)<br />      {<br />            tempPass[i] = (byte)pass[i];<br />      }<br />      // Encrypt password<br />      byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(tempPass);<br />            //Clean tempPass<br />      for (int i = 0; i &lt; tempPass.length; i++)<br />      {<br />            tempPass[i] = 0;<br />      }<br />      return encrypted;<br />}</pre>

  <p>Check to ensure that the Security Account Manager (SAM) database in the registry is secured for standalone servers.</p>
  <br />
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Stand-alone servers store account names and one-way (non-reversible) password hashes (LMHash) in the local Security Account Manager (SAM) database. The SAM is part of the registry. Typically, only members of the Administrators group have access to the account
 information.</p>
  <p>Although the passwords are not actually stored in the SAM and password hashes are not reversible, if an attacker obtains a copy of the SAM database, the attacker can use brute force password techniques to obtain valid user names and passwords.</p>
  <p>Restrict LMHash storage in the SAM by creating the key (not value) <strong>NoLMHash</strong> in the registry as follows:</p>
  <p>
    <strong>HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\NoLMHash</strong>

  <p>Ensure&amp;nbsp;that any untrusted input used in the output stream is first encoded with <strong>HtmlEncode</strong> or <strong>UrlEncode</strong>.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Echoing input directly back to the user makes your application vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. </p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check for this problem:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Look for user supplied input inside HTML tag. </strong>Check for the existence of user supplied input inside html tags your application generates. For instance &lt;A href='somelink'&gt;USERINPUT&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;<br /></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Look for user supplied input elsewhere in your application output. </strong>Check for existing user supplied input in the following locations: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the HTML tags themselves. For instance, &lt;A href='USERINPUT'&gt; </li>
        <li>In database tables that are later used as page content. For instance, you may find unencoded user input in a user profile stored in your database. </li>
        <li>In files that are later used as page content. For instance, you may find unencoded user input in a local configuration file.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify all&amp;nbsp;user&amp;nbsp;input&amp;nbsp;input is encoded. </strong>The untrusted data should be encoded using <strong>HtmlEncode</strong> or <strong>UrlEncode</strong>. Make sure that you encode data at the last possible opportunity before the data is returned to the client. If you encode any earlier, you may not know the exact context that the data will be used in and&amp;nbsp;the corresponding&amp;nbsp;format you need to encode into. Early encoding of some data can also&amp;nbsp;result in double encoding problems. </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Encode untrusted data ensures that it is treated as literal text and not as a script. You can use the <strong>Microsoft.Security.ApplicationAntiXSSLibrary.HtmlEncode</strong> method to encode untrusted data.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you write URLs that might contain unsafe characters because they have been constructed from input data or data from a shared database, use <strong>Microsoft.Security.ApplicationAntiXSSLibrary.UrlEncode</strong> to make them safe. </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong> &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Make sure that you encode data at the last possible opportunity before the data is returned to the client.&amp;nbsp; If you encode any earlier than this, you may not know the exact context that the data will be used in, and hence the format you need to encode into.&amp;nbsp; Also, early encoding of some data can result in double encoding problems. </p>

The <strong>FileAuthorizationModule</strong> does not perform a check for Image.gif, because this is a static file handled internally by IIS. However, because access checks for static files are performed by IIS, the authenticated user must still be granted read permission to the file with an appropriately configured ACL.</p><hr><p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance. </p>]]></Data>

  <p>Check to ensure that intranet traffic is encrypted (for example, with SSL) or restricted if you do not have a secure data center infrastructure.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>For inside (intranet-facing) NICs, if you do not have a secure data center and you have sensitive information passing between computers, you need to consider whether to encrypt the traffic and whether to restrict communications between the Web server and
 downstream servers (such as an application server or database server). Encrypting network traffic addresses the threat posed by network eavesdropping. If the risk is deemed sufficiently small you may choose not to encrypt&amp;nbsp;the traffic.</p>
  <p>The type of encryption used also affects the types of threats that it addresses. For&amp;nbsp;example, SSL is application-level encryption, whereas IPSec is transport layer encryption. As a result, SSL counters the threat of data tampering or information disclosure
 from another process on the same machine, particularly one running under a different account in addition to the network eavesdropping threat.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Do not rely on client-side validation for security purposes. Use server-side validation to ensure that data is safe and perform security decisions based on that. Client-side validation should be used solely to reduce round trips to the server and to improve the user experience.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Client side validation can be easily bypassed. For example, a malicious user could disable the client-side script routines by disabling JavaScript. Users may also construct their own form posts using custom html, or using an HTTP proxy to modify form posts. If developers rely on the controls in the client's user interface and do not validate all results on the back end, it may introduce injection vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to bypass data input restrictions and gain access to unintended application functionality.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>During implementation, ensure all input from the client is validated, even if the input is not stored.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>It's important to specify what input is acceptable, rather than trying to specify all the variations of input that are illegal (whitelisting as opposed to blacklisting). Use ASP.NET validator controls to check user input on the server side and provide feedback to the user when input fails to pass validation requirements. Follow these steps on each form page in an application:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Determine the required fields.</strong> Use the required field validator control to ensure all required fields are present. Here is an example that declares a textfield in an ASP page that is a required field:</p>
      <pre>&lt;td&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:RequiredFieldValidator runat=server<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ControlToValidate=txtName<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ErrorMessage="User ID is required."&gt; *<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/asp:RequiredFieldValidator&gt;<br />&lt;/td&gt;<br />&lt;td&gt;User ID:&lt;/td&gt;<br />&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=text runat=server id=txtName&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</pre>
      <p>The * is displayed next to the label if the input is blank. The error message is reported in a summary. The "ControlToValidate" property specifies the ID of the control to validate. The final step is to add a validation summary to the top of the page like so:</p>
      <pre>&lt;asp:ValidationSummary runat=server<br />HeaderText="There were errors on the page:" /&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enforce numeric range constraints.</strong> Use the RangeValidator control to ensure any numeric values are constrained to a specific, acceptable range. Here is an example that declares an integer field in an ASP page that has a valid range from 1 to 50:</p>
      <pre>&lt;td&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:RangeValidator id="Range1"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ControlToValidate="txtState"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MinimumValue="1"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MaximumValue="50"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Type="Integer"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; EnableClientScript="false"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Text="The value must be from 1 to 10!"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; runat="server"&gt; * <br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/asp:RangeValidator&gt;<br />&lt;/td&gt;<br />&lt;td&gt;State:&lt;/td&gt;<br />&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=text runat=server id=txtState&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Validate verification fields.</strong> Fields such as password entry are often verified by having the user re-type them to ensure they are correct. Use the CompareValidator control to make the comparisons and ensure validity/integrity. Here is an example that declares two password fields in an ASP page that must match in order to validate properly:</p>
      <pre>&lt;asp:CompareValidator runat=server<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ControlToValidate=txtRePWord<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ControlToCompare=txtPWord<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ErrorMessage="Passwords do not match." /&gt;</pre>
      <p>In this case, the two fields being compared are "txtPWord" and "txtRePWord". If they do not match, validation fails with the error message, "Passwords do not match".</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enforce type constraints on string fields.</strong> String fields are the most difficult type of input to effectively validate because the range of acceptable characters is much larger then numeric and enumerated types. Regular expressions provide a flexible mechanism for dictating valid patterns and characters. Use the <em>RegularExpressionValidator</em> to perform a variety of checks on string-based fields such as zip codes and phone numbers. Here is an example that declares an text field in an ASP page that should represent a five digit zip code, consisting entirely of numberic digits, and a validator to enforce those constraints:</p>
      <pre>&lt;input type=text runat=server id=txtZip&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:RegularExpressionValidator runat=server<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ControlToValidate="txtZip"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ErrorMessage="Zip code must be 5 digits, all numbers."<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ValidationExpression="[0-9]{5}"&gt; * <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/asp:RegularExpressionValidator&gt;<br />&lt;td&gt;Zip code:&lt;/td&gt;<br />&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=text runat=server id=txtZip&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use custom validation to handle remaining input constraints.</strong> The built-in ASP.NET validation controls handle most of the cases that commonly arise in Web applications, but there may be times when they are not appropriate. The CustomValidator enables custom validation code that can plugs into the existing validation system. Here is an example that declares a text field in an ASP page. For this particular text field, there is business logic that needs to be satisfied which is not easily constrainable by the other validation constructs, so a custom validator is implementated that ensures the string in the text field does not start with the letter "a":</p>
      <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="vb" %&gt;<br />&lt;script runat=server&gt;</pre>
      <pre>public sub CheckID(source as Object, args as ServerValidateEventArgs)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; args.IsValid = args.Value.substring(0, 1).tolower() &lt;&gt; "a"<br />end sub </pre>
      <pre>&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
      <p>To call this function, add a CustomValidator, which is designed to call developer code to perform its check. Here is the declaration:</p>
      <pre>&lt;asp:CustomValidator runat=server<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; controltovalidate="txtName"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; errormessage="ID is already in use."<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; OnServerValidate="CheckID" /&gt;</pre>
      <p>It is worth noting that this could have been done with the RegularExpression validation control, but in this case it makes more sense to use custom validation since a type of high-level validation that could conceivably be more complex then a simple pattern match is being defined (e.g., the validation rules might change based on application state).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use the Regex class to validate other sources.</strong> Most Web applications accept input from various sources, including HTML controls, server controls, query strings, and cookies. Validate input from all of these sources to help prevent injection attacks. Use regular expressions to help validate input. The following example shows how to use the Regex class.</p>
      <pre>using System.Text.RegularExpressions ;<br />&amp;nbsp;// Instance method:<br />Regex reg = new Regex(@"^[a-zA-Z'.\s]{1,40}$");<br />Response.Write(reg.IsMatch(Request.QueryString["Name"]));<br />// Static method:<br />if (!Regex.IsMatch(Request.QueryString["Name"],@"^[a-zA-Z'.\s]{1,40}$")) <br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Name does not match expression <br />}</pre>
      <p>If you cannot cache your regular expression for frequent use, you should use the static IsMatch method where possible for performance reasons, to avoid unnecessary object creation.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>Consider a very simple form for an online shopping cart. The cart component consists of two components:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>An HTML form that contains all of the fields that make up the order to be submitted for processing:</p>
      <pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />  &lt;head&gt;<br />    &lt;title&gt;Widget shopping cart&lt;/title&gt;<br />  &lt;/head&gt;<br />  &lt;body&gt;<br />    &lt;H1&gt;welcome to the most boring shopping cart on the web!&lt;/H1&gt; </pre>
      <pre>    A widget's current price is $19.95 USD. Please use the following form to submit an order.</pre>
      <pre>    &lt;form action="process_order.aspx" method="POST"&gt;  <br />      &lt;p&gt;Please enter the number of widgets you would like to purchase:&lt;/p&gt;<br />      quantity:&lt;br/&gt;<br />      &lt;select name="WidgetQuantity"&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="1"&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="2"&gt;2&lt;/option&gt; <br />        &lt;option value="3"&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="4"&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;<br />      &lt;/select&gt;</pre>
      <pre>      ...<br />      &lt;input type="submit" value="order"/&gt;<br />    &lt;/form&gt;</pre>
      <pre>  &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An ASP.NET page that processes the form submissions and performs the necessary steps to create the order.</p>
      <pre>int dQuantity = Request("WidgetQuantity");<br />double dPrice = 19.95;<br />double dCost = dQuantity * dPrice;</pre>
      <p>This server side page is problematic because it lacks validation to ensure the quantity field is correct. The application works fine in the case where a user plays by the rules and submits the form as it is shown, because the quantity field ensures that the range constraints for the order quantity are always valid. However, if a clever user decides to construct their own form and submits a negative WidgetQuantity field, it causes a negative balance. Depending on what e-commerce system is used, this could result in a credit to the user's account. It also might subtract the negative balance from the company's inventory, which would carry significant ramifications and costs later on.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>Consider the following ASP.NET page that processes the form submissions and performs the necessary steps to create an order:</p>
  <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="vb" %&gt;<br />&lt;script runat=server&gt;<br />public sub OnSubmit(source as Object, e as EventArgs)<br />    if Page.IsValid then<br />        ' Now we can perform our transaction.<br />       int dQuantity = Request("WidgetQuantity");<br />       double dPrice = 19.95;<br />       double dCost = dQuantity * dPrice;<br />    end if<br />end sub<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&lt;head&gt;<br />&lt;title&gt;Validation Sample&lt;/title&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;<br />&lt;body&gt;</pre>
  <pre>&lt;form runat=server&gt;<br />&lt;asp:ValidationSummary runat=server headertext="There were errors on the page:" /&gt;</pre>
  <pre>&lt;table&gt;<br />  &lt;tr&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;<br />        &lt;asp:RequiredFieldValidator runat=server <br />            controltovalidate="WidgetQuantity"<br />            errormessage="WidgetQuantity is required."&gt;*<br />        &lt;/asp:RequiredFieldValidator&gt;<br />    &lt;/td&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;A widget's current price is $19.95 USD. Please use the following form to submit an order.&lt;/td&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;<br />      &lt;select name="WidgetQuantity"&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="1"&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="2"&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="3"&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="4"&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;<br />      &lt;/select&gt;<br />     &lt;asp:RegularExpressionValidator runat=server display=dynamic<br />            controltovalidate="WidgetQuantity"  <br />            errormessage="WidgetQuantity must be a non-zero, positive integer." <br />            validationexpression="[1-9]{1}[0-9]{0,7}" /&gt;</pre>
  <pre>    &lt;/td&gt;<br />  &lt;/tr&gt;<br />...<br />&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />&lt;input type=submit runat=server id=cmdSubmit value=Submit onserverclick=OnSubmit&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
  <p>The ASP.NET Validator control provides client-side validation to reduce roundtrips to the server and improve user experience, but also provides server-side validation to ensure that the widget quantity field is a positive integer. It is also validated as a required field that must be provided before submitting the order.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that your application clearly defines the boundaries between its protected and unprotected resources.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Defining a boundary between public and restricted content helps establish the check points that will allow access to the restricted content.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>Follow these steps to ensure your application is partitioned into public and protected (restricted) domains: <ol><li><p><strong>Enumerate all web accessible resources. </strong>Identify the protected resources from the public resources. Common protected resources include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Resources that require authentication </li><li>Critical application resources </li><li>Sensitive/confidential data</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Ensure that protected resources have the appropriate access controls. </strong>Determine if all protected resources have the appropriate access controls assigned to them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Check if there is separation on disk between public and protected resources. </strong>Examine the local filesystem structure. Check if a protected resource is located inside a public directory and vice versa.</p></li><li><p><strong>Verify the local system permissions for all resources. </strong>For each resource, check that the local system permissions are set accordingly. If the resource is public, verify that anonymous users can access it. If the resource is protected, verify that only authorized users can access it.</p></li></ol><h1>Problem Example</h1><p>MyApp is a financial tool that generates reports based on sensitive data. It allows the user to upload the financial data and download the report. Since the application is small, all of its content is located within the same directory. The access control is enforced by the web application through checking the required permissions before a given call is executed.</p><p>Since both data and code is within the same directory, it may be possible for an attacker to gain access to the raw financial data.</p>]]></Data>

  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that encryption is used to protect sensitive data that is transmitted over the network.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>When data is sent over the network, it typically passes through several intermediate relays on its way towards some final destination. Using a safe protocol to transmit information is important because it adds protection against a Network Eavesdropping Attack or Man in the Middle Attack during transport.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>When an application transmits sensitive data over the network, it is necessary to ensure that it is encrypted to protect the data from being stolen or modified in transit. To ensure this, follow the steps outlined below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive information.</strong> Sensitive data is any information that is kept secret and should be disclosed only to authorized parties. Common examples of sensitive data include, but are not limited to, names of customers, government issued ID numbers, credit card and other financial information, passwords, and private keys. Some industries, such as health care and banking, have regulatory standards that define sensitive information. Use regulatory requirements, as they apply to your application, to identify sensitive data. Sensitive data can be defined as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information that either contains personally identifiable information or can be used to derive personally identifiable information that should not be shared with others. </li>
        <li>Information that a user provides that they would not want shared with other users of the application. </li>
        <li>Information that comes from an external trusted source that is not designed to be shared with users</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that sensitive data is securely transmitted.</strong> Ensure that your application transmits sensitive data in a secured fashion. Check if your application uses the following approaches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Encrypting the communication links.</strong> Using the "All sensitive communications are encrypted" checklist, check if your application's communication links are properly secured. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Encrypting application data.</strong> If your application encrypts its application data, check if your application securely transforms its application data before transmitting it over the network: </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Hashing.</strong> Hashing is a one-way mechanism for storing sensitive data in a non-retrievable way. If your application uses hashing as means for storing sensitive data, verify that the following pieces are in place:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Salt:</strong> Check if your application generates its salt using the <em>RNGCryptoServiceProvider</em> class. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Function:</strong> Check if your application uses SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 as its hash function. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Invocation:</strong> Check if your application invokes the <em>HMAC.ComputeHash</em> method to perform the hashing procedure. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clean-up:</strong> Check if your application securely cleans-up all instances of the sensitive data after the hashing procedure has been completed. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Encryption.</strong> Encryption is a mechanism for storing and transmitting sensitive data in a retrievable way. If your application uses encryption as means for storing sensitive data, verify that the following pieces are in place:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Encryption Key:</strong> Verify that your application's encryption keys are securely stored inside your application's key store.&amp;nbsp; </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Function:</strong> Check if your application uses AES, AES256, or a similar modern strong symmetric encryption function. 3DES and other, older algorithms should be avoided for new development. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Invocation:</strong> Check if your application invokes the <em>SymmetricAlgorithm.Create</em> and <em>ICryptoTransform.TransformFinalBlock</em> methods to perform the encryption procedure. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clean-up:</strong> Check if your application securely cleans-up all instances of the sensitive data and their encryption keys after the encryption procedure has been completed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to protect sensitive data over the network:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive information.</strong> Sensitive data is any information that is kept secret and should be disclosed only to authorized parties. Common examples of sensitive data include, but are not limited to, names of customers, government issued ID numbers, credit card and other financial information, passwords, and private keys. Some industries, such as health care and banking, have regulatory standards that define sensitive information. Use regulatory requirements, as they apply to your application, to identify sensitive data. Sensitive data can be defined as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information that either contains personally identifiable information or can be used to derive personally identifiable information that should not be shared with others. </li>
        <li>Information that a user provides that they would not want shared with other users of the application. </li>
        <li>Information that comes from an external trusted source that is not designed to be shared with users.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose an appropriate protection mechanism.</strong> Choosing the appropriate protection mechanism may depend on various conditions: purpose of the sensitive data, role of the other network party, infrastructure, and supported technologies. Because sensitive data must be encrypted when in transit, there are two potential strategies — Encrypt the application data or Encrypt the communication channel:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Encrypt the communication channel.</strong> Depending on the current infrastructure and the other network party, it is possible to encrypt the connections using SSL, IPSec, or any technologies supported by the remote party. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Encrypt the application data.</strong> If your application's communication channels cannot be encrypted, encrypt the application data. Hashing or encryption should be used when protecting the application data. Use hashing if the sensitive data will be used only for comparison purposes and the actual contents of the data will never need to be recovered. Use encryption if the sensitive data will need be retrieved at a later stage.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Hashing</strong>: If hashing is used, choose a longer salt, 16 or more bits. The salt is random data that is known only by the application; to guess the value of the original data given the hash, an attacker also has to guess the salt. It is recommended to have a longer salt because it provides a bigger input to the hash function. Assuming that the produced hash is compromised, longer salts makes it more difficult for an attacker to gain access to the sensitive data. If your application uses randomly generated salt, make sure that your application encrypts the random salt and stores it into a configuration file. Use RNGCryptoServiceProvider to generate the salt. Example:</p>
              <pre>public static byte[] GenerateSalt()<br />{<br />    byte[] randBytes = new byte[4];<br />    RNGCryptoServiceProvider gen =<br />     new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();<br />    gen.GetNonZeroBytes(randBytes);<br />    return randBytes;<br />}</pre>
              <p>Choosing a strong hashing algorithm is also important. Stronger algorithms prevent multiple unique pieces of data from producing identical hash values. The current recommendation is to use SHA-256 or stronger.</p>
              <pre>public byte[] HashCredentials(byte[] pass, byte[] salt)<br />{<br />    HMACSHA512 md;<br />    byte[] digest; <br />    md = new HMACSHA256(salt);<br />    md.Initialize();<br />    digest = md.ComputeHash(pass);<br />    md.Clear();<br />    return digest;<br />}</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Encrypting</strong>: If encryption is used, use a key size of 256-bit or higher for symmetric encryption and 2048-bit or higher for public/private key encryption. Use AES for symmetric encryption or RSA for public/private key encryption. You should use symmetric encryption if and only if your application is the only entity that will access the encrypted data. If the data will be accessed by more than one party, use public/private key encryption. Public/private key encryption allows your application to share sensitive data with multiple entities without disclosing its own encryption key.</p>
              <pre>Rijndael encMD;ICryptoTransform encCT;<br />byte[] digest;<br />// The following code obtains the encryption key and initialization vector<br />// from the application's key repository. <br />encMD = Rijndael.Create();<br />encMD.Key = MyApp.Crypto.GetEncryptionKey();<br />encMD.IV = MyApp.Crypto.GetEncryptionIV();<br />encCT = encMD.CreateEncryptor(); <br />// Note that sensitiveData is of type byte[] and contains<br />// data that is sensitive in nature<br />digest = encCT.TransformFinalBlock(sensitiveData, 0, sensitiveData.Length);<br />encMD.Clear();</pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Apply the appropriate protection mechanism</strong>: Evaluate the code and determine the places where sensitive data is transmitted. Apply the established protection mechanism at each location. For instance, if your application processes credit card transactions across a hostile network environment, encrypt the credit card information before transmitting it to the appropriate network entity:</p>
      <pre>void ProcessPayment(byte[] ccInfo, float amount)<br />{<br />    byte[] ccDigest = MyApp.Crypto.EncryptCCInfo(ccInfo);<br />    SqlConnection connection;<br />    SqlCommand command;<br />    SqlDataReader result;<br />    string query = "execute QueuePayment @ccDigest @amount;";<br />    connection = MyApp.DBManager.GetDBConnection();<br />    command = new SqlCommand(query, connection);<br />    command.Parameters.Add("@ccDigest", System.Data.SqlDbType.Binary);<br />    command.Parameters["@ccDigest"].Value = ccDigest;<br />    command.Parameters.Add("@amount", System.Data.SqlDbType.Float);<br />    command.Parameters["@amount"].Value = amount;<br />    ...<br />}</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An e-commerce application written in ASP.NET enables customers to pay their bills online through a unified broker. The application's web component relies on an independent account management system that resides on another server. The web component communicates with the account management system using a SQL socket connection. The two servers are located in a competitively priced data center that houses a number of other customers, all of which are able to access the building at all times. A malicious user purchases hosting services at the same company, and after exploring the hosting environment, learns that the hosted accounts are networked using a shared bus topology that allows for network snooping. Because SQL connections are not encrypted by default, the attacker is able to setup a sniffer and capture all of the communication between the account management component and the web component. This enabled the attacker to login as a legitimate user on the account management server and make changes at will.</p>

  <p>Because data between the two components is encrypted, the transmission medium is less likely to affect the application's ability to securely transmit payment information.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check for input that has not been passed through a validation routine. All input from external sources should be validated.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Input that is not validated can lead to cross-site scripting, SQL injection, directory traversals, and other vulnerabilities which would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>An application can take input via various ways such as a web interface, database, file system or other software running on the server. Use the following steps to establish a validation strategy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all sources of input. </strong>At design time identify all potential sources of input to your application. Once implemented, scour source code to discover sources of input that may have been missed in the design. Potential sources of input in a web application typically include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>URL based parameters </li>
        <li>Form based parameters </li>
        <li>Hidden fields </li>
        <li>Cookies </li>
        <li>HTTP headers (Host, accept types, www authentication, cache settings, encodings, etc) </li>
        <li>Local filesystem </li>
        <li>Database </li>
        <li>Other services running on the system </li>
        <li>Javascript variables </li>
        <li>File upload and attributes (filename, size, data, etc) </li>
        <li>DNS results or host names </li>
        <li>External component call return values (COM, AJAX, ActiveX) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you know&amp;nbsp;the types of input from where your application may receive data, look for all entry points. Good starting points are method parameters and assignment statements. For example: </p>
      <p>This method uses the <em>searchTerm</em> variable:</p>
      <pre>void aggregateData(PrintWriter out, String searchTerm)<br /> ...<br />double[] rData = common.queryDBForIndex(searchTerm);</pre>
      <p>This assignment stores data from a <em>GET</em> request parameter named <em>index</em> and stores it in the string <em>searchTerm</em>. Ensure that this input is validated:</p>
      <pre>String searchTerm = request.getParameter("index");</pre>
      <p>This assignment uses the input that was gathered above to store more input from a database. Verify that <em>searchTerm</em> is validated before this use, and also ensure that <em>rData</em> is validated as another source of input.</p>
      <pre>double[] rData = common.queryDBForIndex(searchTerm);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Trace data from source to sink. </strong>Trace each source of input from the immediate source through your application to its final destination. The final sink may be in memory, on the hard drive, sent over the network or stored in a data store such as a database.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify validation routines. </strong>Each input source should have a validation routine associated with it. Ideally the validation will occur as soon as the input reaches your application. Shared validation routines are better than creating many throughout the code base, so check for consolidation of routines to aid testing and reduce the chance of one-off bugs. If any input source does not have a validation routine associated with it, flag it for fixing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure quality of validators. </strong>Validation routines should check for length, range, format and type. Validation should first check for good data through whitelisting then for known malicious data through blacklisting. Do not rely on client-side validation alone as it can be bypassed easily.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>An application can take input via various ways: web interface, database, file system, other software running on the server, etc. Use the following steps to establish a validation strategy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Establish your application's trust boundary:</strong> The notion is that all input not generated by your application is untrusted.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all sources of input</strong>: An application can have various sources of input and each one is an entry point to your application&amp;nbsp;that can potentially be used to break your application's security model. Enumerate all possible sources of input and make note of the expected input&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;each source. Potential sources of input in a web application typically include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>URL based parameters </li>
        <li>Form based parameters </li>
        <li>Hidden fields </li>
        <li>Cookies </li>
        <li>HTTP headers </li>
        <li>Local filesystem </li>
        <li>Database </li>
        <li>Other related services</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Understand the input that your application can handle and process</strong>: After identifying the different entry points, define the format and type of input that&amp;nbsp;should be provided through each entry point. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Create a set of validators</strong>: Build a validator for each format and type of expected input. Centralize your application's validators as it helps strengthen the code by limiting the amount of scattered validation code throughout your application. Place the set of validators on your application's trust boundary. Your application should accept input from the outside world only through its set of validators.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code produces a data analysis based on a financial index. Unfortunately, the application validates the user's input but not the returned data from the database. Therefore, the application is vulnerable to an integer overflow that can harm the business logic used in generating the data analysis.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that accounts&amp;nbsp;are locked after consecutive failed login attempts. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Multiple, consecutive failed authentication attempts over a short period of time are a symptom that is used to detect when an account is under attack. Locking out the account prevents the attacker from compromising and accessing the account.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Follow these steps to ensure your application will lock out an account after consecutive failed login attempts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify your application has a lockout policy. </strong>An account lockout policy is typically application specific. Review your application's requirements and design specifications and verify the&amp;nbsp;following functionality:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A mechanism for determining failed authentication attempts </li>
        <li>A mechanism for locking accounts that have exceeded the maximum number of allowed authentication attempts </li>
        <li>A mechanism for unlocking accounts that have exceeded the maximum number of allowed authentication attempts</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure your application tracks login attempts. </strong>All authentication procedures should record the number of authentication attempts for each user. The login counter for each user&amp;nbsp;should be&amp;nbsp;reset to 0 upon a successful authentication</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure your application enforces the lockout policy. </strong>All authentication procedures implement your application's lockout policy. The implementation should&amp;nbsp;match the lockout policy as the business requirements of your organization may change over time</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> PCI DSS certification requires that logs should include failed access attempts, that a user gets locked out after no more than 6 failed login attempts, and the lockout lasts for&amp;nbsp;at least&amp;nbsp;30 minutes.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to successfully lock accounts after consecutive failed login attempts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Determine a lockout policy. </strong>There are two variables to consider when determining a lockout policy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number of allowed consecutive failed login attempts </li>
        <li>Amount of time that a locked account will remain locked</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A simple policy would be to lock an account after&amp;nbsp;five failed login attempts for the duration of 15 minutes. Although this is an effective method for blocking a brute force attack, it exposes your application to denial of service as an attacker can easily keep an account locked through a small stream of authentication requests.<br /><br />When determining the lockout policy, it is important to evaluate the risk of attacks against the user and the support costs associated with reactivating a locked account. For example, requiring the user to contact your organization's support staff&amp;nbsp;to reactivate a locked account will have a direct impact on support costs and would add general user frustration.&amp;nbsp;However, it is important to use extra care when designing more sophisticated variations of your application's lockout policy, such as correlating a single or multiple user login attempts with a source IP. When adding extra levels of complexity, carefully consider and evaluate the scenarios where your application's lockout policy can be circumvented or can harm your business. For instance, consider scenarios where an attacker would attempt to compromise a user through the use of multiple hosts, or multiple users would authenticate using a shared office IP.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Track login attempts. </strong>Login attempts can be tracked with the use of a login counter. Increment the counter once a user tries to authenticate. Reset the counter to 0 after the user successfully authenticates. Example:</p>
      <pre>-- Authenticate the user<br />sql&gt; select login_attempts from users<br />      where user = {{username}} and pass = {{passDigest}};<br /> -- Reset the login counter<br />sql&gt; update users set login_attempts = 0 where user = {{username}};</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enforce the lockout policy. </strong>The lockout policy should be enforced at all points in the application where authentication is necessary. Example:</p>
      <pre>String dbStatement = "select login_attempts from users"<br />                   + "where user = ? and pass = ?;";<br />PreparedStatement st = dbConnection.prepareStatement(dbStatement);<br />st.setString(1, user);st.setString(2, passDigest);<br />ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery();<br /><br />if (rs.first())<br />{      <br />userIsValid = true;<br />      loginCount = rs.getInt(1);<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />      userIsValid = false;<br />}<br /><br />rs.close();<br /><br />if(userIsValid)<br />{<br />      if(loginCount &gt; 3)<br />      {<br />            throw new AccountIsLockedException();<br />      }<br /><br />      // The application checks the password's maturity<br />      checkPasswordMaturity(user);<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />      updateLastLoginAttempt(user);<br />}</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set an unlocking mechanism. </strong>Keep track of the lockout period. Based on your application's lockout policy, unlock the account after the lockout period has expired. Example:</p>
      <pre>-- Unlock all locked accounts whose 45 minute lockout period has expired<br />sql&gt; update users set login_attempts = 0<br />      where last_login &lt; (current_timestamp - interval '45' minute);</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> PCI DSS requirements state that an account should be locked out for at least 30 minutes after no more than six failed login attempts.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code executes the database transaction that is required during authentication. Because the transaction fails to check the login attempts counter, it is possible for an attacker to compromise an account through the use of brute force or a dictionary attack.</p>
  <pre>// The application fails to check the number of login attempts<br />String dbStatement = "select user from users where user = ? and pass = ?;";<br />st = dbConnection.prepareStatement(dbStatement);<br />st.setString(1, user);<br />st.setString(2, passDigest);<br />rs = st.executeQuery();</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code executes the database transaction that is required during authentication. Because the transaction checks the login attempts counter, it would be very expensive for an attacker to compromise an account through the use of brute force or a dictionary attack.</p>
  <pre>// The application checks the number of login attempts<br />String dbStatement = "select login_attempts from users where user = ? and pass = ?;";<br />PreparedStatement st = dbConnection.prepareStatement(dbStatement);<br />st.setString(1, user);<br />st.setString(2, passDigest);<br />ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery();<br /><br />if (rs.first())<br />{<br />      userIsValid = true;<br />      loginCount = rs.getInt(1);<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />      userIsValid = false;<br />}<br /><br />rs.close();<br /><br />if(userIsValid)<br />{<br />      if(loginCount &gt; 3)<br />      {<br />            throw new AccountIsLockedException();<br />      }<br />      checkPasswordMaturity(user);<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />      updateLastLoginAttempt(user);<br />}</pre>]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that all input passed to the database is validated.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Unvalidated input can lead to persistent cross-site scripting, SQL injection and other vulnerabilities&amp;nbsp;that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check if all input passed to database is validated:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify database entry points. </strong>Identify all locations within your application that interface with the database servers. Potential sources of input include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>URL based parameters </li>
        <li>Form based parameters </li>
        <li>Hidden fields </li>
        <li>Cookies </li>
        <li>Local filesystem </li>
        <li>Javascript variables</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Trace data from source to sink. </strong>Trace each source of input from the immediate source, through your application and&amp;nbsp;to the backend database.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify validation routines. </strong>Each input source should have a validation routine associated with it. Ideally the validation will occur as soon as the input reaches your application. Shared validation routines are better than creating many throughout the code base, so check for consolidation of routines to aid testing and reduce the chance of one-off bugs. If any input source does not have a validation routine associated with it, flag it for fixing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure quality of validators. </strong>Validation routines should check for length, range, format and type.&amp;nbsp;The validator&amp;nbsp;should first check for good data&amp;nbsp;via whitelisting and then for known malicious data&amp;nbsp;via blacklisting. Do not rely on client-side validation alone as it can be bypassed easily.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure that parameterized queries are used. </strong>Verify that all database transactions are handled using <em>PreparedStatement</em> objects.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To properly validate input passed to database:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Identify database entry points. </strong>Identify all locations within your application that interface with the database servers. Potential sources of input include: <ul><li>URL-based parameters </li><li>Form-based parameters </li><li>Hidden fields </li><li>Cookies </li><li>Local filesystem </li><li>Javascript variables</li></ul></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Create a set of validators. </strong>Determine the appropriate validation at each validator. Centralize the validators as it helps strengthen your code by limiting the amount of scattered validation code throughout the component. Place the validators along the database entry points. All data should pass through the validators before transmitted to the database servers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use type safe SQL parameters in queries. </strong>Stored procedures and parameterized queries improve your application's robustness against SQL injection based attacks.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code allows the user to query a database. Unfortunately, the application fails to validate the user's input; therefore, an attacker can access the backend database on behalf of the application through the use of SQL injection. </p>
  <pre>public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,<br />     HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException{<br />     PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();<br />     String query = request.getParameter("query");<br />     String retData = "";<br /><br />     // The application fails to validate the user-supplied<br />     // query before submitting it to the database server<br />     retData = queryDB(query);<br /><br />     ...<br /><br />     out.flush();<br />     out.close();<br />}</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code allows the user to query a database. Because the application validates the user's input, it is much more difficult for an attacker to access the backend database through a SQL injection attack.</p>
  <pre>public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,<br />     HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException{<br />     PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();<br />     String query = request.getParameter("query");<br />     String retData = "";<br /><br />     // The application validates the user-supplied query<br />     // before submitting it to the database server<br />     if (validateQuery(query))<br />     {<br />          retData = queryDB(query);<br /><br />          ...<br /><br />     }<br /><br />     out.flush();<br />     out.close();<br />}<br /><br /><br />public boolean validateQuery(String input){<br /><br />      // The input can be only of numeric characters<br />      String goodPattern = "[0-9]++";<br /><br />      Pattern p = Pattern.compile(goodPattern);<br />      Matcher m = p.matcher(input);<br /><br />      if(!m.matches())<br />      {<br />            return false;<br />      }<br /><br />      return true;<br />}</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Do not accept file names or paths from users.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Accepting file names or paths from users can result in attackers coercing your application into accessing arbitrary files and resources.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>You should never accept a file name or path from a user under any circumstances.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If user control over file paths or file names is not absolutely necessary, remove the responsible code from the application. If you need to store a file from a user, store it in a database or other non-filesystem data store.&amp;nbsp;Keep the name the user provided as a reference to the file, but do not use it as any form of canonical name.</p>
  <p />
  <p>If the functionality is critical to the proper working of the application, then validate the input for directory traversal and canonicalization attacks:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check File Names. </strong>Ensure that file paths only refer to files within your application's virtual directory hierarchy if that is appropriate. When checking file names, obtain the full name of the file by using the <em>System.IO.Path.GetFullPath</em> method. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check File Paths. </strong>If you use <em>MapPath</em> to map a supplied virtual path to a physical path on the server, use the overloaded <em>Request.MapPath</em> method that accepts a <em>bool</em> parameter so that you can prevent cross-application mapping: </p>
      <pre>try<br />{<br />  string mappedPath = Request.MapPath( inputPath.Text,<br />                         Request.ApplicationPath, false);<br />}<br />catch (HttpException)<br />{<br />  // Cross-application mapping attempted<br />}</pre>
      <p>The final <em>false</em> parameter prevents cross-application mapping. This means that a user cannot successfully supply a path that contains ".." to traverse outside of your application's virtual directory hierarchy. Any attempt to do this results in an exception of type <em>HttpException</em>. </p>
    </li>

  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that Protected resources are mapped to HttpForbiddenHandler.</p>
  <br />
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>HTTP handlers are located in the Machine.config file beneath the <strong>&lt;httpHandlers&gt;
</strong>element. HTTP handlers are responsible for processing Web requests for specific file&amp;nbsp;extensions. Remoting should not be enabled on front-end Web servers; enable remoting only on middle-tier application servers that are isolated from the Internet.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you are running .NET 2.0, the &lt; httpHandlers&gt; setting is located in the machine-level Web.config file, located in the same directory as the Machine.config file.</blockquote>
  <p>The following file extensions are mapped in the Machine.config file to HTTP<strong></strong>handlers: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>.aspx is used for ASP.NET pages </li>
    <li>.rem and .soap are used for Remoting. </li>
    <li>.asmx is used for Web Services. </li>
    <li>.asax, .ascx, .config, .cs, .csproj, .vb, .vbproj, .webinfo, .asp, .licx, .resx,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;.resources are protected resources and are mapped to
<strong>System.Web.HttpForbiddenHandler</strong>. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For .NET&amp;nbsp;Framework resources, if you do not use a file extension, then map the extension to
<strong>System.Web.HttpForbiddenHandler</strong> in the Machine.config file, as shown in the following example:</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;add verb="*" path="*.vbproj" type="System.Web.HttpForbiddenHandler" /&gt;</pre>
  </div>
  <p>In this case, the .vbproj file extension is mapped to <strong>System.Web.HttpForbiddenHandler</strong>. If a client requests a path that ends with .vbproj, then ASP.NET returns a message that states "This type of page is not served."
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The following guidelines apply to handling .NET&amp;nbsp;Framework file extensions: </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Map extensions you do not use to HttpForbiddenHandler</strong>. If you do not serve ASP.NET pages, then map .aspx to
<strong>HttpForbiddenHandler</strong>. If you do not use Web Services, then map .asmx to
<strong>HttpForbiddenHandler</strong>. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Disable Remoting on Internet-facing Web servers</strong>. Map remoting extensions (.soap and .rem) on Internet-facing Web servers to
<strong>HttpForbiddenHandler</strong>. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Disable .NET&amp;nbsp;Remoting</h3>
  <p>To disable .NET&amp;nbsp;Remoting disable requests for .rem and .soap extensions, use the following elements beneath<strong> &lt;httpHandlers&gt;</strong>:</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;add verb="*" path="*.rem" type="System.Web.HttpForbiddenHandler"/&gt;<br />&lt;add verb="*" path="*.soap" type="System.Web.HttpForbiddenHandler"/&gt;</pre>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This does not prevent a Web application on the Web server from connecting to a downstream object by using the Remoting infrastructure. However, it prevents clients from connecting to objects on the Web server.</blockquote>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that an unique key is assigned to each user's ViewState.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>A ViewState is the mechanism used by ASP.NET to keep track of server control state values. It is a hidden form field managed by the ASP.NET page framework and is an encoded aggregate of values of controls on a page. View state is enabled by default in ASP.NET and can be disabled or re-enabled at the machine, application, page, and control level by setting the <strong>EnableViewState</strong> property to <strong>false</strong> or <strong>true</strong> in config files.</p>
  <p>By default, there's nothing in the ViewState that ties its content to a particular user. The attacker can easily reuse the ViewState he obtained making legal access to the page to build a bogus request on behalf of another user. This is where <strong>ViewStateUserKey</strong> is useful.</p>
  <p>The <strong>ViewStateUserKey</strong> property adds user-specific information to the view state. Setting the <strong>ViewStateUserKey</strong> property of the page in the <strong>Page_Init</strong> event handler helps ensuring that any form information submitted came from the same user who requested the original page. It binds the content of the <strong>ViewState</strong> variable to individual users so that the malicious users cannot use the variable to generate an attack.</p>
  <p>This prevents Cross Site Request Forgery attacks, where attackers attempt to use their ViewState in the context of another user or to otherwise post form data as though they were another user. These attacks are also called One-Click Attacks.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that your application's ASP.NET pages have Page_Init methods. </strong>Look for <strong>Page_Init</strong> methods in your application's ASP.NET. The declaration for <strong>Page_Init</strong> is:</p>
      <pre>protected void Page_Init(object sender, EventArgs e)</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that Page.ViewStateUserKey is set during page initialization. </strong>Ensure <strong>Page.ViewStateUserKey</strong> is initialized during page initialization. Example:</p>
      <pre>protected void Page_Init(object sender, EventArgs e<br />{<br />    Page.ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;<br />}</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>Suppose that a&amp;nbsp;web application does not set the <strong>ViewStateUserKey</strong> property in the Page_Init event handler, and this application allows a user to change the state of the application in a single request. This combination means the&amp;nbsp;application is susceptible to a Cross Site Request Forgery Attack. </p>
  <p>For example, consider a web application that allows a logged-in administrator to create a new user sending a single GET request.</p>
  <p>This GET request looks like this:</p>
  <pre>GET http://teammentorexample.com/adduser.aspx?username=joe&amp;password=1234&amp;usertype=user HTTP/1.1</pre>
  <p>The attacker discovers that this request will create a new user and creates his own request which he embeds in an e-mail with the following image tag:</p>
  <pre>&lt;img src=”http://teammentorexample.com/adduser.aspx?username=HACKER&amp;password=TEST&amp;usertype=admin” /&gt;</pre>
  <p>When the victim’s (the administrator in this case) e-mail client attempts to download the image located at the above source, the request is made without the knowledge of the victim. </p>
  <p>The Web page contains a hidden form field named __VIEWSTATE that is already filled with ViewState data. The ViewState can be re-used from a valid request that the attacker had previously made to the application. The ViewState content is not checked on the server or is only checked against tampering. The attacker lures the unsuspecting user into opening the email containing the malicious URL, causing the request to be sent to the server where the ViewState is valid. The server has no way of knowing that the ViewState originated from the attacker. ViewState validation does not counter this attack because the ViewState is valid and the page is executed under the security context of the victim user.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that destinations of redirects and forwards are calculated without user input.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using input to calculate destinations of redirects or forwards may allow an attacker to create hyperlinks that appear to point to legitimate sites but redirect to malicious pages controlled by the attacker. This technique is often used by phishers to trick people into visiting fake sites that steal authentication credentials.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Look for code that handles parameters to see if it performs redirects or forwards based on input. Redirects are also known as "transfers" in .NET. Ideally, redirects and forwards should not rely on user input to calculate their destinations.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to calculate destinations of redirects and forwards without user input:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Find redirects and forwards.</strong> Find all pages that perform redirects or forwards. Redirects are also known as "transfers" in .NET.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify dangerous redirects and forwards.</strong> Find all redirects and forwards that rely on user input to calculate their destinations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Rewrite redirects and forwards.</strong> Consider making design or code changes to get rid of each redirect or forward, if possible. If a redirect or forward is absolutely necessary, consider how it may be rewritten to operate without user input - this is usually possible based on assumptions made in the application design.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure the application automatically locks inactive user accounts. Verify that all instances of locking inactive accounts are logged.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Inactive user accounts increase the attack surface of the application and can be used by an attacker as a means of entry.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Follow these steps during the design phase to make sure your application has the capability to lock its inactive user accounts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify your application stores the user's last login/inactivity information. </strong>Check if your application has the necessary procedures in place to store and retrieve last login and lockout information about its users. Common locations for storing such information are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Database that stores user account information </li>
        <li>Data structures (e.g. Java class) that represent user accounts </li>
        <li>Routines that handle user login </li>
        <li>Routines that retrieve and update user account information</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify your application has a lockout policy. </strong>An account lockout policy is typically application specific. Review your application's requirements and design specifications. Check for the following functionality:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A mechanism for determining user inactivity </li>
        <li>A mechanism for locking inactive accounts </li>
        <li>A mechanism for unlocking disabled accounts </li>
        <li>Verify that the last-login timestamp is reset to the current timestamp upon a successful authentication attempt</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify the lockout policy is enforced by default. </strong>Make sure the functionality that enforces the lockout policy is enabled by default during deployment. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure that only users with administrative privileges can amend your application's lockout policy. </li>
        <li>Verify that all instances of modifying the lockout policy are logged. </li>
        <li>Check the following locations in the code to determine if the lockout policy is fully enforced: <ul><li>Account administration routines </li><li>Background database processes that perform user account maintenance </li><li>Authentication routines</li></ul></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps when locking inactive user accounts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set a lockout policy. </strong>Create the application's lockout policy. Determine the necessary duration of inactivity before an account can be locked/disabled. This policy can vary depending on whether the account is of a normal user or an administrator. For example, disable normal accounts after 45 days of inactivity and administrative accounts after 30 days of inactivity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Keep track of user inactivity. </strong>Establish a mechanism to keep track of the last successful authentication. Successful authentication can be tracked via logs or a timestamp, which resides in the user database. Example: </p>
      <pre>sql&gt; select username, last_login_date from users;<br />+----------+-----------------+<br />| username | last_login_date |<br />+----------+-----------------+<br />| adam     |      2006-10-11 |<br />| sue      |      2006-10-11 |<br />| jim      |      2006-10-01 |<br />| richard  |      2006-10-01 |<br />| julie    |      2006-09-23 |<br />| sam      |      2006-06-23 |<br />+----------+-----------------+</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set a lockout mechanism. </strong>Establish a mechanism to verify the current period of inactivity and automatically set the disabled bit for inactive accounts. Using the application or database server's scheduler, activate such functionality to run during the hours with least user activity. Keep in mind that inactive accounts should be disabled, but not removed until it is confirmed that they should be completely removed. Create a log entry when an account has been disabled.</p>
      <p>For example, the following database transaction would lock all user accounts that have been inactive for more than 30 days. Such transactions should be scheduled to run once a day:</p>
      <pre>sql&gt; update users set locked = 1<br />      where (current_date - 30) &gt; last_login_date</pre>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The statement above uses Oracle syntax. Please consult your database manual if you use a&amp;nbsp;different database engine.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment illustrates the user database of a multi-user application. In its current state, the application logs the last time the user has logged in but does not enforce a lockout policy for its inactive users; therefore, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application by compromising an inactive account.</p>
  <pre>sql&gt; select username, locked, last_login_date from users;<br />+----------+--------+-----------------+<br />| username | locked | last_login_date |<br />+----------+--------+-----------------+<br />| adam     |      0 |      2006-10-11 |<br />| sue      |      0 |      2006-10-11 |<br />| jim      |      0 |      2006-10-01 |<br />| richard  |      0 |      2006-10-01 |<br />| julie    |      0 |      2006-09-23 |<br />| sam      |      0 |      2006-06-23 |<br />+----------+--------+-----------------+</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment illustrates the user database of a multi-user application. Because the application enforces a lockout policy, all of its inactive users have been locked and denied access to the application. Therefore, an attacker cannot compromise the application through its inactive users.</p>
  <pre>sql&gt; select username, locked, last_login_date from users;<br />+----------+--------+-----------------+<br />| username | locked | last_login_date |<br />+----------+--------+-----------------+<br />| adam     |      0 |      2006-10-11 |<br />| sue      |      0 |      2006-10-11 |<br />| jim      |      0 |      2006-10-01 |<br />| richard  |      0 |      2006-10-01 |<br />| julie    |      0 |      2006-09-23 |<br />| sam      |      1 |      2006-06-23 |<br />+----------+--------+-----------------+</pre>]]></Data>

  <p>Check to ensure that administrator account is renamed and has a strong password to improve security.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>The default local Administrator account is a target for malicious use because of its elevated privileges on the computer. To improve security, rename the default Administrator account and assign it a strong password.</p>
  <p>If you intend to perform local administration, configure the account to deny network logon rights and require the administrator to log on interactively. By doing so, you prevent users (well intentioned or otherwise) from using the Administrator account to
 log on to the server from a remote location. If a policy of local administration is too inflexible, implement a secure remote administration solution.

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that SSL&amp;nbsp;is used when transmitting credentials and never unencrypted connections.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using SSL prevents the credentials from being&amp;nbsp;identified or tampered with as they are transmitted over the network.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that a dedicated SSL-enabled server is used for the authentication component of your application. </strong>Ensure that your application's authentication component runs on a dedicated subdomain and a server that accepts only HTTPS traffic. Disallowing unencrypted HTTP connections will prevent accidental or malicious unsecured connections. Check that the server uses valid SSLv3 certificates that have been signed by a trusted certification authority. Disallowing lower SSL versions, such as SSLv1 and SSLv2 will ensure that weaker encryption methods can not be exploited by an attacker.<br /><br />The following URL should connect and prompt for login credentials:</p>
      <pre>https://login.example.com/myapp/login</pre>
      <p>An HTTP URL to the same server and component should either be disallowed or redirect to its HTTPS counterpart:</p>
      <pre>http://login.example.com/myapp/login</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify forms that send credentials. </strong>Forms are defined by a <em>&lt;form&gt;</em> tag in the HTML document, such as the one below:</p>
      <pre>&lt;form method="POST" action="https://login.example.com/myapp/login"&gt;</pre>
      <p>Forms that include credentials usually, but won't always, include an input field with a <em>TYPE</em> attribute set to <em>password</em>:</p>
      <pre>&lt;input <strong>type</strong>="<strong>password</strong>" name="pass" size=25&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure that form data is sent using HTTPS. </strong>Examine the <em>ACTION</em> attribute of the <em>&lt;form&gt;</em> tag and ensure it posts to an absolute URL path and includes HTTPS in the URL, as shown below: </p>
      <pre>&lt;form method="POST" <strong>action</strong>="<strong>https</strong>://login.example.com/myapp/login"&gt;</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) over HTTP requires the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Create a certificate request.</strong> Using your hosting server or OpenSSL, generate an SSL certificate request. Example:</p>
      <pre># Generate private key<br />openssl genrsa -des3 -out privkey.pem 2048 <br /># Generate certificate request using private key<br />openssl req -new -key privkey.pem -out cert.csr</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Present the request to a Certification Authority (CA).</strong> If all conditions for obtaining an SSL certificate are met, the CA will produce a new SSL certificate based on the certificate request. Because the requirements for obtaining an SSL certificate depend on the Certification Authority, consult with the Certification Authority in regards to the administrative steps necessary for obtaining such certificate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Install the certificate.</strong> Consult with the hosting server's documentation on how to install the SSL certificate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure credentials are sent over SSL.</strong> Place the authentication portion of your application on a dedicated subdomain. Configure the server to accept only HTTPS traffic for the authentication subdomain. Ensure that form posts containing credentials are sent over HTTPS. This is accomplished by using absolute URL paths in the action field. Example:</p>
      <pre>&lt;form method="POST" action="https://login.example.com/myapp/login"&gt;</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>In the following snippet, the credentials are transmitted over unprotected HTTP. This allows an attacker to easily steal credentials from sniffed traffic.</p>
  <pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />  &lt;head&gt;<br />    &lt;title&gt;login form&lt;/title&gt;<br />  &lt;/head&gt;<br />  &lt;body&gt;<br />    &lt;form method="POST" action="http://login.example.com/myapp/login"&gt;<br />    &lt;input type="text" name="user" size=25&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />    &lt;input type="password" name="pass" size=25&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />    &lt;input type="submit" name="submit" value="log in"&gt;<br />    &lt;/form&gt;<br />  &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>In the following snippet, the credentials are transmitted over HTTPS. This makes it difficult for an attacker to steal credentials from sniffed traffic:</p>
  <pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />  &lt;head&gt;<br />    &lt;title&gt;login form&lt;/title&gt;<br />  &lt;/head&gt;<br />  &lt;body&gt;<br />    &lt;form method="POST" action="https://login.example.com/myapp/login"&gt;<br />    &lt;input type="text" name="user" size=25&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />    &lt;input type="password" name="pass" size=25&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />    &lt;input type="submit" name="submit" value="log in"&gt;<br />    &lt;/form&gt;<br />  &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>]]></Data>

  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that all remote administrative sessions take place over an encrypted channel, sessions timed out quickly and accounts locked out when suspicious behavior is detected.</p>
  <br />
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Administrators often need to be able to administer multiple servers. Make sure the requirements of your remote administration solution do not compromise security. If you need remote administration capabilities, then the following recommendations help improve
 security: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Restrict the number of administration accounts</strong>. This includes restricting the number of administration accounts as well as restricting which accounts are allowed to log on remotely.
</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Restrict the tools</strong>. The main options include Internet Services Manager and Terminal Services. Another option is Web administration (using the IISAdmin virtual directory), but this is not recommended and this option is removed by IISLockdown.exe.
 Both Internet Services Manager and Terminal Services use Windows security. The main considerations here are restricting the Windows accounts and the ports you use.
</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Restrict the computers that are allowed to administer the server</strong>. IPSec can be used to restrict which computers can connect to your Web server.

  <p>Check to ensure that the&amp;nbsp;anonymous account does not have write access to Web content directories and cannot execute command-line tools because attackers target this well known account to perform malicious actions.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>To secure the anonymous account: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Deny write access to Web content directories</strong>.
<p>Make sure that it is not possible for this account to write to content directories, for example, to deface Web sites.
</p></li>
    <li>
      <strong>Restrict access to System tools</strong>.
<p>In particular, restrict access to command-line tools located in \WINNT\System32.
</p></li>
    <li>
      <strong>Assign permissions to groups instead of individual accounts</strong>.
<p>Assigning users to groups and applying permissions to groups instead of individual accounts is good practice. For the anonymous account, create a group and add the anonymous account to it and then explicitly deny access to the group for key directories and
 files. Assigning permissions to a group allows you to more easily change the anonymous account or create additional anonymous accounts because you do not need to recreate the permissions.
</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;IISLockdown denies write access to content directories for the anonymous account by applying a deny write access control entry (ACE) for the Web Anonymous Users and Web Applications groups. It also adds a deny execute ACL
 on command-line tools.</blockquote></li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use separate accounts for separate applications</strong>.
<p>If your Web server hosts multiple applications, use a separate anonymous account for each application. Add the accounts to an anonymous Web users group, for example, the
<strong>Web Anonymous Users</strong> group created by IISLockdown, and then configure NTFS permissions using this group.
</p><p>For more information about using multiple anonymous accounts and hosting multiple applications, see Chapter 20, "<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302436.aspx">Hosting Multiple ASP.NET Applications</a>."

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that all forms that require authentication or can be used to trigger important functionality are protected with ViewStateUserKey.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>A one-click attack consists of posting a malicious HTTP form to a known, vulnerable Web site. It is called "one-click" because it usually begins with an unaware victim clicking on an alluring link received through e-mail or found when navigating a crowded forum.&amp;nbsp; By following the link, the user inadvertently triggers a remote process that ends up submitting the malicious form to a site.&amp;nbsp; This allows an attacker to perform any action caused by the vulnerable form with the credentials of the victim.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>ViewStateUserKey</strong> makes it much harder for hackers to use the content of the client-side view state to prepare malicious posts against the site.&amp;nbsp; Each time a form is invoked, a unique key is generated.&amp;nbsp; The key contains encrypted time and session information, and the form submission is rejected if it is used in another session or after the session timeout has expired. </p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check whether ViewStateUserKey is used properly:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify pages that should be protected. </strong>Review your application and make a list of all the forms that should be protected with ViewStateUserKey.&amp;nbsp; Forms that meet either of the following criteria should be protected:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The form requires authentication </li>
        <li>The form triggers important application behavior or a write operation to a persistent store (eg. SQL database)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check to see if the pages are protected. </strong>ViewStateUserKey can be set per page or in the <strong>OnInit</strong> virtual method of the page-derived class.&amp;nbsp; </p>
      <ol>
        <li>First check <strong>OnInit</strong>, if you find protection there, then all of your pages are covered.<br /><br /><pre>protected override OnInit(EventArgs e) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; base.OnInit(e); <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;<br />}</pre></li>
        <li>Next check the individual pages, for instance:<br /><br /><pre>void Page_Init (object sender, EventArgs e) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;<br />}</pre></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>The&amp;nbsp;following code added to each&amp;nbsp;of your pages will set the key based on SessionID.</p>
  <pre>void Page_Init (object sender, EventArgs e) {<br />   ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;<br />}</pre>
  <p>Alternatively, you can add this code to the <strong>OnInit</strong> virtual method of the <strong>Page</strong>-derived class.&amp;nbsp; (Note that you must set this property in the <strong>Page.Init</strong> event).&amp;nbsp; This will allow you to write the code once rather than per page.</p>
  <pre>protected override OnInit(EventArgs e) {<br />   base.OnInit(e); <br />   ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;<br />}</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that your application does not rely solely upon ASP.NET request validation to protect against malicious input.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Request validation will catch some attacks; however, it provides only basic input validation. Do not rely on it. Use it as an extra precautionary measure in addition to your own input validation. Only you can define what represents good input for your application. </p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To check for this problem, you must determine if your application is relying solely upon request validation to provide input and data validation. Use the following steps:&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Find all sources of input in your application.</strong> During design time identify all of the potential sources of input to your application. Scour the source code to discover sources of input that may have been missed in the design. Compile a list that you can use in the following steps. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify validation routines.</strong> Each input source should have a data validation routine associated with it.&amp;nbsp;Ideally the validation will occur as soon after the input reaches your application as possible. Shared validation routines are better than creating many spread throughout your code base, so check for consolidation of routines to aid testing and reduce the chance of one-off bugs. If an input source does not have a validation routine associated with it, flag it for fixing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure quality of validation routines.</strong> Validation routines&amp;nbsp;should check for length, range, format, and type. Validation should check first&amp;nbsp;for known valid and safe data and then for malicious, dangerous data. Do not rely on filtering out all malicious data because&amp;nbsp;it is too easy to miss something. Do not rely on client-side validation alone as it can be easily bypassed.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Check for known good data and constrain input by validating it for type, length, format, and range.&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: Validating input does not remove the need to format output, parameterize queries, or otherwise handle user input carefully.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An ASP.NET application uses forms authentication; however, it relies upon request validation to validate the form of the username and password entered by the user.&amp;nbsp;The application does not contain any validation routines to check input for length, range, format and type.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>An ASP.NET application uses forms authentication and has a variety of other input fields for user interaction.&amp;nbsp; Request validation has been left on as a precautionary measure; however, it is not the sole defense mechanism against malicious input. The application authors have included validation routines through which all untrusted input and data is passed before it is used by the application.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that&amp;nbsp;the ASP.NET Role Manager is used for role-based authorization&amp;nbsp;rather than&amp;nbsp;custom code.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>ASP.NET provides a role manager feature that automatically creates, manages and looks up roles for the authenticated user. Role managers reduce the possibilities&amp;nbsp;of serious security issues from programmer errors&amp;nbsp;as well as&amp;nbsp;reduce the amount of custom code needed for an application. </p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check if your application is using the Role Manager:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Check for the existence of the &lt;<strong>roleManager</strong>&gt; element beneath the &lt;<strong>system.web</strong>&gt; section of your application's Web.config file and make sure the <strong>enabled</strong> attribute is set to <strong>true.</strong></li>
    <li>Ensure there is a connection string in the &lt;<strong>connectionStrings</strong>&gt; section that points to your roles store. </li>
    <li>Ensure there is a specific provider configured in the &lt;<strong>roleManager</strong>&gt;<strong></strong>element. </li>
    <li>Check that the <strong>defaultProvider</strong> attribute on the &lt;<strong>roleManager</strong>&gt; element points to your chosen role provider. </li>
    <li>Check your application's code and ensure it is using the Role Manager API (for example <strong>Roles.IsUserInRole </strong>and <strong>Roles.CreateRole</strong>) whenever a roles check takes place.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>User authentication access checks </li>
    <li>Role access from the configured role store by the <strong>RoleManager</strong> HTTP module using the configured role provider </li>
    <li>URL and file authorization </li>
    <li>Programmatic role checks</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This order means that role information cannot be used for an unauthenticated user. It also means that role access can be used for URL and file authorization.</p>
  <p>To use the role manager feature in an ASP.NET application, you need to do the following: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Add a &lt;<strong>roleManager</strong>&gt; element beneath the &lt;<strong>system.web</strong>&gt; section of your application's Web.config file and enable role manager by setting its <strong>enabled</strong> attribute to <strong>true</strong>. </li>
    <li>Add a connection string to the &lt;<strong>connectionStrings</strong>&gt; section to point to your roles store. If you are using the <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong>, this is an LDAP query string pointing to your Authorization Manager Policy store in Active Directory or ADAM. If you are using the <strong>SqlRoleProvider</strong>, this is a database connection string that points to your role store database. </li>
    <li>Configure the specific provider in the &lt;<strong>roleManager</strong>&gt;<strong></strong>element in your application's Web.config file. The role manager system supports the following providers: </li>
    <li>If your application roles are in an Authorization Manager Policy store in Active Directory or ADAM, use the <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong>. </li>
    <li>If your application roles are in a SQL Server database, use the <strong>SqlRoleProvider.</strong></li>
    <li>If your application uses Windows groups as roles, use the <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong>. Note that this is recommended to be used with Windows Authentication only. </li>
    <li>If your application roles are in a store other than those previously listed, create a custom roles provider inheriting <strong>RoleProvider</strong> base class. </li>
    <li>Set the <strong>defaultProvider</strong> attribute on the &lt;<strong>roleManager</strong>&gt; element to the chosen role provider. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>To check roles and manage roles, use the Role Manager API (for example <strong>Roles.IsUserInRole </strong>and <strong>Roles.CreateRole</strong>). </p>

  <p>Check that your application validates all input parameters, including regular and hidden form fields, query strings, and cookies.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>To protect your application from denial of service attacks and code injection attacks, including SQL injection and XSS.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>This is an important guideline and should be followed all the time.&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Restrict the fields that the user can enter and modify and validate all values coming from the client. If you have predefined values in your form fields, users can change them and post them back to receive different results. Permit only known good values wherever possible. For example, if the input field is for a state, only inputs matching a state postal code should be permitted.</p>
  <p>The <strong>System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex</strong> class helps validate input parameters. For example, the following code shows how to use this class to validate a name passed through a query string parameter. The same technique can be used to validate other forms of input parameters, for example, from cookies or form fields. For example, to validate a cookie parameter, use <strong>Request.Cookies</strong> instead of <strong>Request.QueryString</strong>.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Lock users' accounts after consecutive failed login attempts.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Multiple consecutive failed authentication attempts over a short period of time are a symptom that is used to detect when an account is under attack. Locking out the account can prevent&amp;nbsp;an attacker from compromising and accessing the account.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Your application should lock an account if the user has unsuccessfully tried to authenticate multiple times within a small period of time.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to successfully lock accounts after consecutive failed login attempts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Determine a lockout policy. </strong>There are two variables to consider when determining a lockout policy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number of allowed consecutive failed login attempts </li>
        <li>Amount of time that a locked account will remain locked</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A simple policy would be to lock an account after&amp;nbsp;five failed login attempts for the duration of 15 minutes. Although this is an effective method for blocking a brute force attack, it exposes your application to denial of service as an attacker can easily keep an account locked through a small stream of authentication requests.<br /><br />When determining the lockout policy, it is important to evaluate the risk of attacks against the user and the support costs associated with reactivating a locked account. For example, requiring the user to contact your organization's support staff&amp;nbsp;to reactivate a locked account will have a direct impact on support costs and would add general user frustration.&amp;nbsp;However, it is important to use extra care when designing more sophisticated variations of your application's lockout policy, such as correlating a single or multiple user login attempts with a source IP. When adding extra levels of complexity, carefully consider and evaluate the scenarios where your application's lockout policy can be circumvented or can harm your business. For instance, consider scenarios where an attacker would attempt to compromise a user through the use of multiple hosts, or multiple users would authenticate using a shared office IP.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Track login attempts. </strong>Login attempts can be tracked with the use of a login counter. Increment the counter once a user tries to authenticate. Reset the counter to 0 after the user successfully authenticates. Example:</p>
      <pre>-- Authenticate the user<br />sql&gt; select login_attempts from users<br />      where user = {{username}} and pass = {{passDigest}};<br /> -- Reset the login counter<br />sql&gt; update users set login_attempts = 0 where user = {{username}};</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enforce the lockout policy. </strong>The lockout policy should be enforced at all points in the application where authentication is necessary. Example:</p>
      <pre>String dbStatement = "select login_attempts from users"<br />                   + "where user = ? and pass = ?;";<br />PreparedStatement st = dbConnection.prepareStatement(dbStatement);<br />st.setString(1, user);st.setString(2, passDigest);<br />ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery();<br /><br />if (rs.first())<br />{      <br />userIsValid = true;<br />      loginCount = rs.getInt(1);<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />      userIsValid = false;<br />}<br /><br />rs.close();<br /><br />if(userIsValid)<br />{<br />      if(loginCount &gt; 3)<br />      {<br />            throw new AccountIsLockedException();<br />      }<br /><br />      // The application checks the password's maturity<br />      checkPasswordMaturity(user);<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />      updateLastLoginAttempt(user);<br />}</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set an unlocking mechanism. </strong>Keep track of the lockout period. Based on your application's lockout policy, unlock the account after the lockout period has expired. Example:</p>
      <pre>-- Unlock all locked accounts whose 45 minute lockout period has expired<br />sql&gt; update users set login_attempts = 0<br />      where last_login &lt; (current_timestamp - interval '45' minute);</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> PCI DSS requirements state that an account should be locked out for at least 30 minutes after no more than six failed login attempts.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code executes the database transaction that is required during authentication. Because the transaction fails to check the login attempts counter, it is possible for an attacker to compromise an account through the use of brute force or a dictionary attack.</p>
  <pre>// The application fails to check the number of login attempts<br />String dbStatement = "select user from users where user = ? and pass = ?;";<br />st = dbConnection.prepareStatement(dbStatement);<br />st.setString(1, user);<br />st.setString(2, passDigest);<br />rs = st.executeQuery();</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code executes the database transaction that is required during authentication. Because the transaction checks the login attempts counter, it would be very expensive for an attacker to compromise an account through the use of brute force or a dictionary attack.</p>
  <pre>// The application checks the number of login attempts<br />String dbStatement = "select login_attempts from users where user = ? and pass = ?;";<br />PreparedStatement st = dbConnection.prepareStatement(dbStatement);<br />st.setString(1, user);<br />st.setString(2, passDigest);<br />ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery();<br /><br />if (rs.first())<br />{<br />      userIsValid = true;<br />      loginCount = rs.getInt(1);<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />      userIsValid = false;<br />}<br /><br />rs.close();<br /><br />if(userIsValid)<br />{<br />      if(loginCount &gt; 3)<br />      {<br />            throw new AccountIsLockedException();<br />      }<br />      checkPasswordMaturity(user);<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />      updateLastLoginAttempt(user);<br />}</pre>]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Avoid using redirects or forwards if possible.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Redirects or forwards may be manipulated by an attacker to create hyperlinks that appear to point to legitimate sites, but actually point to attacker-controlled malicious pages. This technique is oftened used by phishers to trick people into trusting a fake web site.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Use this guideline when writing a web application that uses redirects or forwards. Avoid using redirects or forwards in web applications, if possible.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to avoid using redirects or forwards:</p>
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enumerate redirects and forwards.</strong> Review application code to find all redirects and forwards used by the application.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Review application design.</strong> Determine how redirects and forwards figure into the application design. Consider making design changes to remove the need for redirects and forwards.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Remove redirects or forwards.</strong> Remove the redirects and forwards that are not necessary after changes to the application design.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Secure the remaining redirects or forwards.</strong> If there appears to be no reasonable way to get rid of redirects or forwards, use related guidelines to secure the remaining redirects or forwards.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>Consider an on-line banking application that has an insecure redirect:</p>
  <pre>http://www.onlinebank.com/redirect.asp?url=[destination]</pre>
  <p>A phisher may create the following hyperlink to point to his own site and send it in spam messages to millions of people:</p>
  <pre>http://www.onlinebank.com/redirect.asp?url=www.phisher.com</pre>
  <p>When a user sees a link that appears to point to his bank at onlinebank.com in an e-mail message, he clicks that link and sees a web site that looks exactly like the bank's, but is actually a phishing web site used to steal authentication credentials. The user enters his account number and PIN into the web page, receives an error message telling him to try again, and is redirected to the bank's real site. After entering his credentials again, the user successfuly views his account. However, the phisher now has the user's online banking information.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The best solution to unvalidated redirects or forwards is to not use redirects or forwards at all. Considering the problem example above, a simple solution would be to remove the redirect.asp page after making the necessary changes to the application design.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use Prepared Statements to execute SQL statements. Do not generate SQL statements directly from user input.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Parameterized Queries mitigate the number one risk for database-facing Web applications: SQL injection. This powerful attack is language independent, as it depends on the algorithm used to generate SQL strings passed to the database and affects the database engine, not the actual application.</p>
  <p>It exploits the creation of the SQL string, in which user input is embedded manually with escape sequences (such as the single quote (<strong>'</strong>) or double quote (<strong>"</strong>) characters). Using this method, an attacker inserts valid SQL statement fragments as part of user input so they, in turn, are embedded within the SQL query that is submitted to the database engine for execution. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially compromise the entire database and often the underlying operating system. </p>
  <p>Parameterized Queries offer a simple yet efficient mitigation since they automatically contain user-input in a non-escaped form, "compiling" the query and passing the input as parameters, much like a function call. There is no known method of injecting custom SQL over Parameterized Queries.</p>
  <p>Additionally, using Parameterized queries offers two significant advantages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Greater Efficiency</strong>: The database engine needs to "compile" the statement only once, allowing for greater efficiency in query invocation. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Greater Security</strong>: The database engine automatically handles the parsing and embedding of user input, effectively negating any potential for SQL injection due to attackers taking advantage of delimiter characters such as a single quote (<strong>'</strong>) or a double quote (<strong>"</strong>). </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Type-safe SQL parameters should be used whenever SQL statements need to be executed by the database. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>One way of making the application less susceptible to SQL injection attacks is by using stored procedures. Stored procedures are subroutines stored in the database that are available to applications for accessing the data. </p>
  <p>Just using stored procedures isn't a complete remedy for SQL injection. The important thing to do is use parameters with stored procedures, or else your stored procedures can be susceptible to SQL injection if they use unfiltered input. Stored procedures provide several security advantages: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>By parameterizing input parameters and type-enforcing them, user input is effectively filtered. </li>
    <li>Stored procedures are allowed by most databases&amp;nbsp;to execute under different security privileges than&amp;nbsp;from the database user, thereby restricting the ability of the application to do anything beyond the actions specified in the stored procedures. For instance, an application would have execute access to a stored procedure but no access to the base tables. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>To use type-safe SQL parameters, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>If possible, use stored procedures. </strong>Stored procedures are pre-compiled statements that are stored on the database server. Using stored procedures improves your application's performance and security.&amp;nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the SQL queries. </strong>Locate all SQL queries throughout your application. Example:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Connection cn = MyApp.getDBConnection();<br />Statement st = cn.createStatement();<br />String query = "select login_attempts from myappUsers where user = \"" + user<br />             + "\" and pass = \"" + new String(passDigest) + "\";";<br />ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery(query);</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the parameters in each SQL query. </strong>After locating all SQL queries, identify the parameters in each query. Understand the format and type of each parameter's data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use PreparedStatement. </strong>Java supports parameterized queries via its <strong>PreparedStatement</strong> class. <strong>PreparedStatement</strong> is mapped by most databases to a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Although the implementation may differ&amp;nbsp;among databases, the functionality is the same. Turn all SQL queries into parameterized queries. To accomplish this, turn all <strong>Statement</strong> objects into <strong>PreparedStatement</strong> objects. For example, the SQL query from Step 1 would be:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Connection cn = MyApp.getDBConnection();<br />PreparedStatement st = cn.prepareStatement("select login_attempts from myappUsers"<br />                     + " where user = ? and pass = ?;");<br />st.setString(1, user);<br />st.setString(2, new String(passDigest));<br />ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery();.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code validates the user based on a given username and password. It hashes the password with a random salt, then it compares the username and the produced hash against the data stored in the backend database. Unfortunately, the SQL query is dynamically crafted by using the user's input. If there is no proper input validation, an attacker can access the application's database server through the use of SQL injection.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />      // Hash the credentials before querying the credential store<br />      // The application crafts the SQL query based on user's input<br />      Connection cn = MyApp.getDBConnection();<br />      Statement st = cn.createStatement();<br />      String query = "select login_attempts from myappUsers where user = \""<br />                    + user + "\" and pass = \"" + passHash + "\";";<br />      ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery(query);<br />       // Execute the rest of the authentication steps<br />}</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code validates the user based on given username and password. It hashes the password with a random salt, then it compares the username and the produced hash against the data stored in the backend database. Because the application uses <strong>PreparedStatement</strong>, it is much more difficult for an attacker to gain access to the application's database server through the use of SQL injection. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />      // Hash the credentials before querying the credential store<br />      // The application uses parameterized queries<br />      Connection cn = MyApp.getDBConnection();<br />      PreparedStatement st = cn.prepareStatement("select user from myappUsers"<br />                            + " where user = ? and pass = ?;");<br />      st.setString(1, user);<br />      st.setString(2, passHash);<br />      ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery();<br />       // Execute the rest of the authentication steps<br />}</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Validate all data that is passed between Java code and native code.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Unchecked input and/or output can lead to buffer overflows, injection based attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting, etc., that can&amp;nbsp;exploit weaknesses in the application.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Your application should always verify data that is passed between native code and Java.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>There are several things to consider when validating input/output between native and Java code: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check language barriers. </strong>Distinguishing&amp;nbsp;the boundaries between native and Java code is very important. Because the Java sandbox provides multiple security checks to its code, it is important to know the boundary&amp;nbsp;between&amp;nbsp;where the Java sandbox ends and the compiled code begins&amp;nbsp;to interact&amp;nbsp;directly with the CPU, so you can&amp;nbsp;compensate for&amp;nbsp;the lack of such checks inside the native code.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Validate for length, range, format and type. </strong>After discovering the language boundaries, determine the type, format and structure of the data that is passed between Java and native code. Build a validator for each type of data that is passed between the two environments. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Construct a set of validators. </strong>Centralize your application's validators as it helps strengthen the code by limiting the amount of scattered validation code throughout your application. Place the set of validators on the language barriers. Your application should pass data between native and Java code only through its set of validators.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment shows a JNI code that utilizes a COM object. Making the assumption that the Java code will handle data validation, the JNI segment does not verify that the passed input is a valid GUID. Since invalid GUIDs may cause unhandled exceptions, an attacker can force the application to disclose its call stack and possibly its source filenames.</p>
  <pre>#include &lt;jni.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;atlbase.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;windows.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;wtypes.h&gt;<br />JNIEXPORT jboolean<br />JNICALL Java_Identifier_invokeObject<br />      (JNIEnv * env, jobject jobj, jstring jguid)<br />{<br />      HRESULT result;<br />      CLSID clsid;<br />      IUnknown *pIunkn;<br />      LPWSTR guid;<br />      jboolean iscopy;<br />      jboolean ret = false;<br />      char* temp_guid = (*env)-&gt;GetStringUTFChars(env, jguid, &amp;iscopy);<br />      //The application fails to verify that the GUID is valid<br />      guid = SysAllocStringLen(0, 38);<br />      MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, temp_guid, -1, guid, 38);<br />      result = GUIDFromString(guid, &amp;clsid);<br />      ...<br />      return ret;<br />}</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment shows a JNI code that utilizes a COM object. Because the passed input is validated as being a GUID, the application reduces the risk of unhandled exceptions.</p>
  <pre>#include &lt;jni.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;atlbase.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;windows.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;wtypes.h&gt;  <br />JNIEXPORT jboolean <br />JNICALL Java_Identifier_invokeObject<br />      (JNIEnv * env, jobject jobj, jstring jguid)<br />{<br />      HRESULT result;<br />      CLSID clsid;<br />      IUnknown *pIunkn;<br />      LPWSTR guid;<br />      jboolean iscopy;<br />      jboolean ret = false;<br />      char* temp_guid = (*env)-&gt;GetStringUTFChars(env, jguid, &amp;iscopy);<br />      // The application verifies that the input matches the criteria for a GUID<br />      if(!validGUID(temp_guid))<br />      {<br />            return ret;<br />      }<br />      guid = SysAllocStringLen(0, 38);<br />      MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, temp_guid, -1, guid, 38);<br />      result = GUIDFromString(guid, &amp;clsid);<br />       ...<br />      return ret;<br />}<br /><br />bool validGUID(char *guid)<br />{<br />      // Check that GUID is of right length<br />      if(strlen(guid) != 38) return false;<br />      // Sample GUID: {1EF4A023-143A-4e0e-AD72-69C2C68C2D70<br />}<br />      if(guid[0]  != '{') return false;<br />      if(guid[9]  != '-') return false;<br />      if(guid[14] != '-') return false;<br />      if(guid[19] != '-') return false;<br />      if(guid[24] != '-') return false;<br />      if(guid[37] != '}') return false;<br />      int i=1;<br />      while(i&lt;37)<br />      {<br />            if((guid[i] &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; guid[i] &lt;= 'f')<br />                  || (guid[i] &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; guid[i] &lt;= 'F')<br />                  || (guid[i] &gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; guid[i] &lt;= '9')<br />            {<br />                  // GUID is valid<br />            }<br />            else<br />            {<br />                  return false;<br />            }<br />            i++;<br />            if(i == 9 || i == 14 || i == 19 || i == 24)<br />            {<br />                  i++;<br />            }<br />      }<br /><br />      return true;<br />}</pre>

  <p>Disable directory browsing for your application's web directories.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Directory browsing allows an attacker to browse your application's directory structure in search of unprotected files and components.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Disable directory browsing at all times.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to successfully disable directory browsing:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify if directory browsing is enabled. </strong>Navigate to your application's directories. Identify&amp;nbsp;whether your application's server correctly returns an HTTP error message. If it incorrectly returns&amp;nbsp;the directory contents, continue with the following steps.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Locate the default servlet's configuration. </strong>Open your application's deployment descriptor (e.g. web.xml), and locate the default servlet's configuration. If the default servlet is present, it is mapped to the root directory of your application. Example: </p>
      <pre>&lt;servlet&gt;<br />      &lt;servlet-name&gt;default_servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;<br />      &lt;servlet-class&gt;<br />            org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet<br />      &lt;/servlet-class&gt;<br />&lt;/servlet&gt;<br />&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;<br />      &lt;servlet-name&gt;default_servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;<br />      &lt;url-pattern&gt;/&lt;/url-pattern&gt;<br />&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Deny directory browsing in the default servlet's configuration. </strong>Initialize the default servlet with the parameter <em>listings</em> set to <em>false</em>. Example:</p>
      <pre>&lt;servlet&gt;<br />      &lt;servlet-name&gt;default_servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;<br />      &lt;servlet-class&gt;<br />            org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet<br />      &lt;/servlet-class&gt;<br /><strong>      &lt;init-param&gt;<br /></strong>            &lt;param-name&gt;listings&lt;/param-name&gt;<br />            &lt;param-value&gt;false&lt;/param-value&gt;<br /><strong>      &lt;/init-param&gt;<br /></strong>&lt;/servlet&gt;<br />&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;<br />      &lt;servlet-name&gt;default_servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;<br />      &lt;url-pattern&gt;/&lt;/url-pattern&gt;<br />&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure your JSP files are located under the WEB-INF/ directory of your web application.</strong> This ensures that an attacker cannot directly access those pages, however your application can perform internal forwards to these pages.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An application is deployed on a production server. Unfortunately, the developers did not disable directory browsing. This allows an attacker to search for unprotected configuration files.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Do not rely on client-side validation for security purposes. Use server-side validation to ensure that data is safe and perform security decisions based on that. Client-side validation&amp;nbsp;should be used solely to&amp;nbsp;reduce round trips to the server and to improve the user experience.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Client side validation can be easily bypassed. For example, a malicious user could disable&amp;nbsp;the client-side script routines by disabling JavaScript.&amp;nbsp;Users&amp;nbsp;may also construct their own&amp;nbsp;form posts using custom html, or&amp;nbsp;using an&amp;nbsp;HTTP proxy to modify form posts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If developers rely on the controls in the client's user interface and do not validate all results on the back end, it may introduce injection vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to bypass data input restrictions and gain access to unintended application functionality.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>During implementation, ensure all input from&amp;nbsp;the client is&amp;nbsp;validated, even if the input is not stored.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>It's important to specify what input is acceptable, rather then trying to specify all&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;variations&amp;nbsp;of input that are&amp;nbsp;illegal (whitelisting as opposed to blacklisting).&amp;nbsp;Use ASP.NET validator controls to check user input on the server side and provide feedback to the user when input fails to pass validation requirements.&amp;nbsp;Follow these steps on each form page in an application: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Determine the required fields.</strong> Use the required field validator control to ensure all required fields are present. Here is an example that declares a textfield in an ASP page that is a required field:</p>
      <pre>&lt;td&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:RequiredFieldValidator runat=server <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ControlToValidate=txtName<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ErrorMessage="User ID is required."&gt; *<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/asp:RequiredFieldValidator&gt;<br />&lt;/td&gt;<br />&lt;td&gt;User ID:&lt;/td&gt;<br />&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=text runat=server id=txtName&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</pre>
      <p>The * is displayed next to the label if the input is blank. The error message is reported in a summary. The "ControlToValidate" property specifies the ID of the control to validate. The final step is to add a validation summary to the top of the page like so:</p>
      <pre>&lt;asp:ValidationSummary runat=server <br />HeaderText="There were errors on the page:" /&gt;<br /></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enforce numeric range&amp;nbsp;constraints.</strong> Use the RangeValidator control to ensure any numeric values are constrained to a specific, acceptable&amp;nbsp;range. Here is an example that declares an integer field&amp;nbsp;in an ASP page that has&amp;nbsp;a valid range from 1 to 50:</p>
      <pre>&lt;td&gt;</pre>
      <pre>  &lt;asp:RangeValidator id="Range1"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ControlToValidate="txtState"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MinimumValue="1"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MaximumValue="50"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Type="Integer"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; EnableClientScript="false"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Text="The value must be from 1 to 10!"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; runat="server"&gt; * </pre>
      <pre>&amp;nbsp; &lt;/asp:RangeValidator&gt;<br />&lt;/td&gt;<br />&lt;td&gt;State:&lt;/td&gt;<br />&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=text runat=server id=txtState&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Validate&amp;nbsp;verification fields.</strong> Fields such as password entry are often verified by having the user re-type them to ensure they are correct. Use the CompareValidator control to make the comparisons and ensure validity/integrity. Here is an example that declares&amp;nbsp;two password&amp;nbsp;fields&amp;nbsp;in an ASP page that&amp;nbsp;must match in order to validate properly:</p>
      <pre>&lt;asp:CompareValidator runat=server<br />            ControlToValidate=txtRePWord<br />            ControlToCompare=txtPWord<br />             ErrorMessage="Passwords do not match." /&gt;</pre>
      <p>In this case, the two fields being compared are "txtPWord" and "txtRePWord". If they do not&amp;nbsp;match, validation fails with the error message, "Passwords do not match.".&amp;nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enforce type constraints on string fields.</strong> String fields are the most difficult type of input to effectively validate because the range of acceptable&amp;nbsp;characters is much larger then numeric&amp;nbsp;and enumerated types. Regular expression provide a flexible mechanism for dictating valid patterns and characters. Use the RegularExpressionValidator to perform a variety of checks on string-based fields such as zip codes and phone numbers.&amp;nbsp; Here is an example that declares an&amp;nbsp;text field&amp;nbsp;in an ASP page that should represent a five digit zip code, consisting entirely of numeric digits, and a validator to enforce those constraints:</p>
      <pre>&lt;input type=text runat=server id=txtZip&gt;<br />      &lt;asp:RegularExpressionValidator runat=server<br />             ControlToValidate="txtZip"<br />             ErrorMessage="Zip code must be 5 digits, all numbers."<br />             ValidationExpression="[0-9]{5}"&gt; * </pre>
      <pre>      &lt;/asp:RegularExpressionValidator&gt;</pre>
      <pre>&lt;td&gt;Zip code:&lt;/td&gt;<br />&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=text runat=server id=txtZip&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use custom validation to handle remaining&amp;nbsp;input constraints.</strong> The built-in ASP.NET&amp;nbsp;validation controls handle&amp;nbsp;most of the cases that commonly arise in&amp;nbsp;web applications, but there&amp;nbsp;may be&amp;nbsp;times when they are not appropriate.&amp;nbsp;The CustomValidator enables custom validation code that can plugs into the existing validation system.&amp;nbsp;Here is an example that declares a&amp;nbsp;text field&amp;nbsp;in an ASP page. For this particular text field, there is business logic that needs to be satisfied which is not easily constrainable by the&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;validation constructs, so a&amp;nbsp;custom validator is implementated that ensures the&amp;nbsp;string&amp;nbsp;in the text field&amp;nbsp;does not start&amp;nbsp;with the letter "a":</p>
      <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="vb" %&gt;<br />&lt;script runat=server&gt;</pre>
      <pre>public sub CheckID(source as Object, args as ServerValidateEventArgs)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; args.IsValid = args.Value.substring(0, 1).tolower() &lt;&gt; "a"<br />end sub </pre>
      <pre>&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
      <p>To call this function, add a CustomValidator, which is designed to call developer code to perform its check. Here is the declaration:</p>
      <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:CustomValidator runat=server<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; controltovalidate="txtName" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; errormessage="ID is already in use." <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; OnServerValidate="CheckID" /&gt;</pre>
      <p>It is worth noting that this could have been done with the RegularExpression validation control, but in this case it makes more sense to use custom validation since&amp;nbsp;a type of high-level validation that could conceivably be more complex then a simple pattern match is being defined (e.g., the validation rules might change based on application state).&amp;nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use the Regex class to validate other sources</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Most Web applications accept input from various sources, including HTML controls, server controls, query strings, and cookies. Validate input from all of these sources to help prevent injection attacks. Use regular expressions to help validate input. The following example shows how to use the <strong>Regex</strong> class. </p>
      <pre>using System.Text.RegularExpressions ;<br /> // Instance method:Regex reg = new Regex(@"^[a-zA-Z'.\s]{1,40}$");<br />Response.Write(reg.IsMatch(Request.QueryString["Name"]));<br />// Static method:<br />if (!Regex.IsMatch(Request.QueryString["Name"],@"^[a-zA-Z'.\s]{1,40}$"))<br /> {<br />   // Name does not match expression<br /> }</pre>
      <p>If you cannot cache your regular expression for frequent use, you should use the static <strong>IsMatch</strong> method where possible for performance reasons, to avoid unnecessary object creation.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>Consider a very simple form for an online shopping cart. The cart component consists of two components:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>An HTML form that contains all of the fields that make up the order to be submitted for processing:</p>
      <pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />  &lt;head&gt;<br />    &lt;title&gt;Widget shopping cart&lt;/title&gt;<br />  &lt;/head&gt;<br />  &lt;body&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;H1&gt;welcome to the most boring shopping cart on the web!&lt;/H1&gt; </pre>
      <pre>    A widget's current price is $19.95 USD. Please use the following form to submit an order.</pre>
      <pre>    &lt;form action="process_order.aspx" method="POST"&gt;  <br />      &lt;p&gt;Please enter the number of widgets you would like to purchase:&lt;/p&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;   quantity:&lt;br/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&lt;select name="WidgetQuantity"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; &lt;option value="1"&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;   &lt;option value="2"&gt;2&lt;/option&gt; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;   &lt;option value="3"&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;   &lt;option value="4"&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/select&gt;</pre>
      <pre>      ...<br />      &lt;input type="submit" value="order"/&gt;<br />    &lt;/form&gt;</pre>
      <pre>  &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An ASP.NET page that processes the form submissions and performs the necessary steps to create the order.</p>
      <pre>int&amp;nbsp;dQuantity = Request("WidgetQuantity");<br />double dPrice = 19.95;</pre>
      <pre>double dCost = dQuantity * dPrice;</pre>
      <p>This server side page is problematic because it lacks validation to ensure the quantity field is correct.&amp;nbsp;The application&amp;nbsp;works fine in the case where a user plays by the rules and submits the form as it is shown, because the&amp;nbsp;quantity field ensures that the range constraints for the order quantity are always valid.&amp;nbsp;However, if a clever user decides to construct their own form and submits a negative WidgetQuantity field, it causes a negative balance. Depending on what e-commerce system is used, this could result in a credit to the user's account. It also&amp;nbsp;might subtract the negative balance from the company's inventory, which would carry significant ramifications and costs&amp;nbsp;later on.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>Consider the following ASP.NET page that processes the form submissions and performs the necessary steps to create an order:</p>
  <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="vb" %&gt;<br />&lt;script runat=server&gt;<br />public sub OnSubmit(source as Object, e as EventArgs)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if Page.IsValid then<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ' Now we can perform our transaction.<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; int dQuantity = Request("WidgetQuantity");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; double dPrice = 19.95;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; double dCost = dQuantity * dPrice;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; end if<br />end sub<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&lt;head&gt;<br />&lt;title&gt;Validation Sample&lt;/title&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;<br />&lt;body&gt;</pre>
  <pre>&lt;form runat=server&gt;<br />&lt;asp:ValidationSummary runat=server headertext="There were errors on the page:" /&gt;</pre>
  <pre>&lt;table&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;tr&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;td&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:RequiredFieldValidator runat=server <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; controltovalidate="WidgetQuantity"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; errormessage="WidgetQuantity is required."&gt;*<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/asp:RequiredFieldValidator&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;td&gt;A widget's current price is $19.95 USD. Please use the following form to submit an order.&lt;/td&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;td&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;select name="WidgetQuantity"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;option value="1"&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;option value="2"&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;option value="3"&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;option value="4"&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/select&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:RegularExpressionValidator runat=server display=dynamic<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; controltovalidate="WidgetQuantity"&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; errormessage="WidgetQuantity must be a non-zero, positive integer." <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; validationexpression="[1-9]{1}[0-9]{0,7}" /&gt;</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/td&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/tr&gt;<br />...<br />&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />&lt;input type=submit runat=server id=cmdSubmit value=Submit onserverclick=OnSubmit&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
  <p>The ASP.NET Validator control provides client-side validation to reduce roundtrips to the server and improve user experience, but also provides server-side validation to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ensure that the widget quantity field is&amp;nbsp;a positive integer. It is also validated as a required field that must be provided before submitting the order.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Avoid constructing SQL queries in code that include user input; instead, prefer parameterized stored procedures that use type safe SQL parameters.&amp;nbsp;If stored procedures&amp;nbsp;cannot be used, use parameterized dynamic SQL statements.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Database queries constructed dynamically&amp;nbsp;from user input&amp;nbsp;are susceptible to SQL injection. A successful SQL injection attack enables a malicious user to execute commands&amp;nbsp;on the&amp;nbsp;application's database instance by using the privileges granted to&amp;nbsp;the application's login. Using stored procedures with parameterized SQL is recommended because SQL parameters are type safe&amp;nbsp;and treated as&amp;nbsp;literal values by the database,&amp;nbsp;not as executable code. Parameters are also checked for type and length. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Always use parameterized SQL queries. Avoid constructing SQL queries directly from&amp;nbsp;any input, including form fields, query string parameters, and cookies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To protect&amp;nbsp;an application from SQL injection, perform the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use parameters with stored procedures.</strong> Stored procedures alone&amp;nbsp;will not prevent SQL injection.&amp;nbsp;Lack&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;parameter usage means that&amp;nbsp;stored procedures will be susceptible to SQL injection, especially if they use unfiltered input. The following code shows how to use SqlParameterCollection when calling a stored procedure:</p>
      <pre>using System.Data;<br />using System.Data.SqlClient;</pre>
      <pre>using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; DataSet userDataset = new DataSet();<br />&amp;nbsp; SqlDataAdapter myCommand = new SqlDataAdapter( <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "LoginStoredProcedure", connection);<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add("@au_id", SqlDbType.VarChar, 11);<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters["@au_id"].Value = AuthId.Text;</pre>
      <pre>&amp;nbsp; myCommand.Fill(userDataset);<br />}</pre>
      <p>In this case, the @au_id parameter is treated as a literal value and not as executable code. Also, the parameter is checked for type and length. In the preceding code example, the input value cannot be longer than 11 characters. If the data does not conform to the type or length defined by the parameter, the SqlParameter class throws an exception.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use parameters with dynamic SQL.</strong> If stored procedures are unavailable, use parameters when constructing dynamic SQL statements. The following code shows how to use SqlParametersCollection with dynamic SQL:</p>
      <pre>using System.Data;<br />using System.Data.SqlClient;</pre>
      <pre>using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; DataSet userDataset = new DataSet();<br />&amp;nbsp; SqlDataAdapter myDataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "SELECT au_lname, au_fname FROM Authors WHERE au_id = @au_id", <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connection);&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add("@au_id", SqlDbType.VarChar, 11);<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters["@au_id"].Value = AuthId.Text;<br />&amp;nbsp; myDataAdapter.Fill(userDataset);<br />}</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An ASP.NET book purchasing application has a query interface that allows book titles and authors to be de retrieved by submitting an ISBN. The appllication developer's writes a SQL query&amp;nbsp;to accomplish this task:</p>
  <pre>string SQLstr = "SELECT book_name, author_name FROM book WHERE book_ISBN = '" + ISBN.Text + "'";</pre>
  <p>The&amp;nbsp;ISBN input is from a textfield in the&amp;nbsp;web&amp;nbsp;form which is used to directly generate&amp;nbsp;the SQL statement. For example:</p>
  <pre>SELECT book_name, author_name FROM book WHERE book_ISBN = '0321194330'</pre>
  <p>Consider what happens when a user types the following string in the&amp;nbsp;ISBN text box, which is expecting an ISBN in the form nnnnnnnnnn:</p>
  <pre>' ; DROP DATABASE pubs&amp;nbsp; --<br />&amp;nbsp; </pre>
  <p>The code inserts the user's malicious input and generates the following query.</p>
  <pre>SELECT book_name, author_name FROM book WHERE book_ISBN = ''; DROP DATABASE pubs --'&amp;nbsp; </pre>
  <p>In this case, the ' (single quotation mark) character that starts the rogue input terminates the current string literal in the SQL statement. The ; (semicolon) character tells SQL that this is the end of the current statement, which is then followed by the following malicious SQL code. Finally, the -- (double dash) sequence of characters is a SQL comment that tells SQL to ignore the rest of the text. In this case, SQL ignores the closing ' (single quotation mark) character, which would otherwise cause a SQL parser error.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>An ASP.NET book purchasing application has a query interface that allows book titles and authors to be de retrieved by submitting an ISBN. The appllication developer's writes a SQL query&amp;nbsp;to accomplish this task:</p>
  <pre>string SQLstr = "book_name, author_name FROM book WHERE book_ISBN = '" + ISBN.Text + "'";</pre>
  <p>The ISBN input is from a textfield in the&amp;nbsp;web&amp;nbsp;form which is used to directly generate&amp;nbsp;the SQL statement. For example:</p>
  <pre>SELECT book_name, author_name FROM book WHERE book_ISBN = '0321194330'</pre>
  <p>The&amp;nbsp;SQL&amp;nbsp;statement can be made safer by re-writing it as a parameterized, stored procedure:</p>
  <pre>using System.Data;<br />using System.Data.SqlClient;</pre>
  <pre>using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; DataSet userDataset = new DataSet();<br />&amp;nbsp; SqlDataAdapter myDataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "'0321194330'= @isbn",&amp;nbsp;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connection);&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add("@isbn", SqlDbType.VarChar, 11);<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters["@isbn"].Value = ISBN.Text;<br />&amp;nbsp; myDataAdapter.Fill(userDataset);<br />}</pre>
  <p>The SQL query statement&amp;nbsp;is constructed similarly to&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;first SQL statement, except that the&amp;nbsp;ISBN column selection criteria is represented as a placeholder rather than directly concatenated into the SQL query. The next two lines specify the variable type, the expected length, and the&amp;nbsp;value of the&amp;nbsp;ISBN field used in this particular query.&amp;nbsp; This protects against SQL injection attacks because @isbn is specified as a VarChar, which means it can't possibly be an executable SQL statement.&amp;nbsp;Consequently, it will&amp;nbsp;be interpreted by the database driver as a&amp;nbsp;String literal.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is important to note that while parameterized, stored procedures will help reduce the risk of SQL injection, there are other script injection vulnerabilities that will be possible. For more information see&amp;nbsp;the related guideline, "Validate Untrusted Input Passed to Data Access Methods".</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use SSL to protect session cookies on authenticated pages. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Failing to protect authentication tickets is a common vulnerability that can lead to unauthorized spoofing and impersonation, session hijacking, and elevation of privilege.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All systems which use cookies for authentication should protect those cookies via SSL on all pages which require authentication, and ensure that the cookies are not used/sent for pages which do not require authentication and do not use SSL. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Set <strong>requireSSL="true"</strong> on the &lt;<strong>forms</strong>&gt; element, as shown in the following code.</p>
  <pre>&lt;forms loginUrl="Secure\Login.aspx"<br />       requireSSL="true" ... /&gt;  </pre>
  <br />
  <p>By setting <strong>requireSSL="true"</strong>, you set the <strong>secure</strong> cookie property that determines whether browsers should send the cookie back to the server. With the <strong>secure</strong> property set, the cookie is sent by the browser only to a secure page that is requested using an HTTPS URL.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Do not rely on the ASP.NET request validation feature to detect all bad input. Use it only as an extra precautionary measure in addition to your own input validation.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The ASP.NET request validation feature only performs basic input validation and should not be relied upon to detect all types of malicious data. It is not sufficient even for preventing attacks like cross site scripting and SQL injection, and each application has specific validation needs—what is good input to one application may be bad input for another.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>When user input is submitted from a webpage back to the server.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Request validation is enabled by default. You can see this by examining the <strong>validateRequest</strong> attribute, which is set to true on the <strong>&lt;pages&gt;</strong> element in the <strong>Machine.config.comments </strong>file. This will automatically try to validate all input submitted to the web application. Ensure that it is enabled for all pages except those that need to accept a range of HTML elements. If you need to disable it for a page, set the <strong>ValidateRequest</strong> attribute to <strong>false</strong> by using the <strong>@Page</strong> directive as follows:</p>
  <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" ValidateRequest = "false" %&gt;</pre>
  <p>This feature can also be called explicitly by the server by using the <strong>Request.ValidateInput()</strong> call.</p>
  <p>Remember, whether using the page directive to automatically validate or calling <strong>Request.ValidateInput() </strong>explicitly, our aim is to only use this feature as an added precaution. In order to ensure that you are handling user data correctly, ensure that you are following all of these steps: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Always validate input as strictly as possible against the expected input format via regular expressions.</li>
    <li>Ensure that all queries are fully parameterized, especially if they use user input.</li>
    <li>Do not make any security decisions based on user input.</li>
    <li>Do not allow users to input filenames or paths.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>In this example which uses an online shopping cart. The cart component consists of two components:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>An HTML form that contains all of the fields that make up the order to be submitted for processing:</p>
      <pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />  &lt;head&gt;<br />    &lt;title&gt;Widget shopping cart&lt;/title&gt;<br />  &lt;/head&gt;<br />  &lt;body&gt;<br />    &lt;H1&gt;welcome to the most boring shopping cart on the web!&lt;/H1&gt;<br />     A widget's current price is $19.95 USD. Please use the following form to submit an order.<br />    &lt;form action="process_order.aspx" method="POST"&gt;<br />       &lt;p&gt;Please enter the number of widgets you would like to purchase:&lt;/p&gt;<br />       quantity:&lt;br/&gt;<br />       &lt;select name="WidgetQuantity"&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="1"&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="2"&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="3"&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="4"&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;<br />      &lt;/select&gt;<br />      ...<br />      &lt;input type="submit" value="order"/&gt;<br />    &lt;/form&gt;<br />  &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An ASP.NET page that relies on the request validation feature and processes the form submissions and performs the necessary steps to create the order.</p>
      <pre>......<br />try<br />{<br />   Request.ValidateInput();<br />}<br />catch(HttpRequestValidationException e)<br />{<br />   //error out<br />}<br />int dQuantity = Request("WidgetQuantity");<br />double dPrice = 19.95;<br />double dCost = dQuantity * dPrice;<br />......</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>This server side page is problematic because it solely relies on the ASP.NET request validation feature. The application works fine in the case where a user plays by the rules and submits the form as it is shown, because the quantity field ensures that the range constraints for the order quantity are always valid. However, if a clever user decides to construct their own form and submits a negative WidgetQuantity field, it causes a negative balance. Depending on what e-commerce system is used, this could result in a credit to the user's account. It also might subtract the negative balance from the company's inventory, which would carry significant ramifications and costs later on.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>Consider the following ASP.NET page that processes the form submissions and performs the necessary steps to create an order:</p>
  <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="vb" %&gt;<br />&lt;script runat=server&gt;public sub OnSubmit(source as Object, e as EventArgs)<br />    if Page.IsValid then<br />        ' Now we can perform our transaction.<br />        int dQuantity = Request("WidgetQuantity");<br />        double dPrice = 19.95;<br />        double dCost = dQuantity * dPrice;<br />    end if<br />end sub<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&lt;head&gt;<br />&lt;title&gt;Validation Sample&lt;/title&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;<br />&lt;body&gt;<br />&lt;form runat=server&gt;<br />&lt;asp:ValidationSummary runat=server headertext="There were errors on the page:" /&gt;<br />&lt;table&gt;<br />  &lt;tr&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;<br />        &lt;asp:RequiredFieldValidator runat=server<br />             controltovalidate="WidgetQuantity"<br />             errormessage="WidgetQuantity is required."&gt;<br />        &lt;/asp:RequiredFieldValidator&gt;<br />    &lt;/td&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;A widget's current price is $19.95 USD. Please use the following form to submit an order.&lt;/td&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;<br />      &lt;select name="WidgetQuantity"&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="1"&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="2"&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="3"&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;<br />        &lt;option value="4"&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;<br />      &lt;/select&gt;<br />     &lt;asp:RegularExpressionValidator runat=server display=dynamic<br />            controltovalidate="WidgetQuantity"<br />            errormessage="WidgetQuantity must be a non-zero, positive integer." <br />            validationexpression="[1-9]{1}[0-9]{0,7}" /&gt;<br />    &lt;/td&gt;<br />  &lt;/tr&gt;<br />...<br />&lt;/table&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;<br />&lt;input type=submit runat=server id=cmdSubmit value=Submit onserverclick=OnSubmit&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
  <p>The ASP.NET Validator control provides client-side validation to reduce roundtrips to the server and improve user experience, but also provides server-side validation to ensure that the widget quantity field is a positive integer. It is also validated as a required field that must be provided before submitting the order.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use URL authorization to control which users and groups of users have access to the application or to parts of the application. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Rather than having to password protect pages, URL Authorization allows you to tie page access to user accounts or roles.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application restricts access to some pages use URL Authorization to enforce these restrictions.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To configure URL authorization, use an &lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; element in Web.config and specify which user and/or role names are allowed access to the current directory or the nominated directory or file. ASP.NET on Windows Server 2003 or later protects all files in a given directory, even those not mapped to ASP.NET, such as .html, .gif, and .jpg files. </p>
  <p>Authorization settings in Web.config refer to all of the files in the current directory and all subdirectories unless a subdirectory contains its own Web.config with an &lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; element. In this case, the settings in the subdirectory override the parent directory settings. </p>
  <p>URL authorization can be used for both forms authentication and Windows authentication. In the case of Windows authentication, user names take the form "DomainName\WindowsUserName" and role names take the form "DomainName\WindowsGroupName". The local administrators group is referred to as "BUILTIN\Administrators". The local users group is referred to as "BUILTIN\Users". The following example shows Windows users and Windows roles. </p>
  <pre>&lt;authorization&gt;  <br />&lt;allow users="DomainName\Bob, DomainName\Mary" /&gt;  <br />&lt;allow roles="BUILTIN\Administrators, DomainName\Manager" /&gt;  <br />&lt;deny users="*" /&gt;<br />&lt;/authorization&gt;  </pre>
  <p>The following example uses a custom role. </p>
  <pre>&lt;authorization&gt;  <br />&lt;allow roles="Manager"/&gt;  <br />&lt;deny users="*"/&gt;<br />&lt;/authorization&gt;  </pre>
  <p>To apply authorization rules to a specific file or folder, enclose the &lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; element inside a &lt;<strong>location</strong>&gt; element as shown here. </p>
  <pre>&lt;location path="Secure" &gt;  <br />&lt;system.web&gt;    <br />&lt;authorization&gt;      <br />&lt;deny users="?" /&gt;    <br />&lt;/authorization&gt;  <br />&lt;/system.web&gt;<br />&lt;/location&gt;  </pre>
  <p>This example denies access to unauthenticated users and forces a redirect to the login page that is specified on the &lt;<strong>forms</strong>&gt; element. </p>
  <p>The following example shows how you can apply authorization to a specific file (Page.aspx). </p>
  <pre>&lt;location path="page.aspx"&gt;    <br />&lt;authorization&gt;        <br />...    <br />&lt;/authorization&gt;<br />&lt;/location&gt;  </pre>
  <p>If necessary, you can apply different authorization rules for separate pages based on the identity, or more commonly, the role membership of the caller, by using multiple &lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; elements within separate &lt;<strong>location</strong>&gt; elements. </p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use type-safe parameters when constructing dynamic SQL queries or when passing parameters to stored procedures. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>If you use the Parameters collection, SQL treats the input is as a literal value rather then as executable code. The Parameters collection can be used to enforce type and length constraints on input data. Values outside of the range trigger an exception. If type safe SQL parameters are not used, attackers might be able to execute injection attacks that are embedded in the unfiltered input.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>This guideline is applicable whenever there is an SQL statement that is built dynamically. It is also appropriate whenever stored procedures are utilized.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>One way of making the application less susceptible to SQL injection attacks is by using stored procedures. Stored procedures are subroutines stored in the database that are available to applications for accessing the data. </p>
  <p>Just using stored procedures isn't a complete remedy for SQL injection. The important thing to do is use parameters with stored procedures, else, your stored procedures can be susceptible to SQL injection if they use unfiltered input. Stored procedures provide several security advantages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>By parameterizing input parameters and type enforcing them, user input is effectively filtered </li>
    <li>Stored procedures are allowed to execute under different security privileges from the database user by most databases, thereby restricting the ability of the application to do anything beyond the actions specified in the stored procedures. For instance, an application would have execute access to a stored procedure, but no access to the base tables.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To use type safe SQL parameters, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>If possible, use stored procedures.</strong> Stored procedures are pre-compiled statements that are stored on the database server. Using stored procedures improves your application's performance and security.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Determine the parameters in the SQL query or stored procedure being constructed.</strong> All parameters that result from user input or another untrusted source should be escaped, by specifying variable names in the query:</p>
      <pre>SELECT * from books WHERE ISBN = '@isbn'</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Declare the explicit data types for each parameter in the SQL statement.</strong> When executing the SQL statement, specify the data type and length for each parameter in the query:</p>
      <pre>myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add("@isbn", SqlDbType.VarChar, 10);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Specify the value for each parameter.</strong> The untrusted input is then specified, so that it can be properly handled when the SQL statement executes:</p>
      <pre>myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters["@isbn"].Value = '0494483923';</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>Consider an ASP.NET application that handles employee payroll functionality for a small company. One of the pages requires retrieving an employee record from a table based on a username and password supplied via a login dialog. The developer of the application created an SQL SELECT query to accomplish said task:</p>
  <pre>using (SqlConnection myConnection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))<br /><pre>SqlConnection myConnection = new SqlConnection("Data Source=localhost\\sqlexpress;<br />            Initial Catalog=EmployeePayroll;<br />            Integrated Security=True");<br />string SQLstr = "SELECT * from users WHERE username = '" + un.Text + <br />              "' AND password = '" + <br />              pass.Text + "'";</pre><pre>SqlCommand myCommand = new SqlCommand(SQLstr, myConnection);</pre><pre>SqlDataAdapter myDataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(myCommand);</pre><pre>myCommand.Connection.Open();</pre><pre>SqlDataReader myReader = myCommand.ExecuteReader();<br /></pre></pre>
  <p>In the preceding example, the SELECT statement will work as expected, assuming that the input is perfectly constrained. However, what happens if a user enters unexpected input such as '1234' for a password, and this for a username:</p>
  <pre>mjones' AND 1=1; -- </pre>
  <p>This will result in the SQL statement being executed at the database level:</p>
  <pre>SELECT * from users WHERE username = 'mjones' AND 1=1; --'  AND password = '1234';</pre>
  <p>This will allow the person entering data into the dialog box to select the account details of mjones without the correct password.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>Consider an ASP.NET application that handles employee payroll functionality for a small company. One of the pages requires retrieving an employee record from a table based on a username and password supplied via a login dialog. The developer of the application uses the following SQL query to take advantage of type safe parameters with the SqlParameterCollection when constructing the query dynamically:</p>
  <pre>
    <pre>using System.Data;<br />using System.Data.SqlClient;    </pre>
    <pre>using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; DataSet userDataset = new DataSet();<br />&amp;nbsp; SqlDataAdapter myDataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "SELECT * from users WHERE username = '@uname' AND password = '@pwd'", connection);&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add("@uname", SqlDbType.VarChar, 24);<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add("@pwd", SqlDbType.VarChar, 16);  
  myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters["@uname"].Value = un.Text;  
  myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters["@pwd"].Value = pass.Text;
&amp;nbsp; myDataAdapter.Fill(userDataset);
}  </pre>
  </pre>
  <p>In the preceding code example, the input values are constrained for length and escaped. If the data does not conform to the type or length defined by the parameter, the SqlParameter class throws an exception.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to protect the authentication credentials and authentication cookies passed between browser and server. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>By using SSL, you make it much more difficult for an attacker to monitor the network connection and obtain authentication credentials and capture authentication cookies to gain spoofed access to your application. </p>
  <p>SSL also can improve user trust in your application as it authenticates the server to the client, thus proving the end point for communications.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>SSL should be used for forms based authentication. </p>
  <p>If you cannot use SSL, reduce the session lifetime with the timeout attribute on the forms element.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Restrict the authentication cookie to HTTPS connections. </strong>Cookies support a "secure" property that determines whether or not browsers should send the cookie back to the server. With the secure property set, the cookie is sent by the browser only to a secure page that is requested using an HTTPS URL.</p>
      <p>Set the secure property by using <strong>requireSSL="true"</strong> on the <strong>&lt;forms&gt;</strong> element as follows:</p>
      <pre>&lt;forms loginUrl="Secure\Login.aspx"<br />       requireSSL="true" . . . /&gt;&amp;nbsp;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Encrypt the cookie and check its integrity. </strong>Encrypt the cookie and check its integrity, even if you are using SSL. This prevents an attacker from viewing or modifying the cookie if he or she manages to steal it through a XSS exploit. In this event, the attacker can still use the cookie to gain access to your application. The best way to mitigate this risk is to implement the appropriate countermeasures to prevent XSS attacks (described under "Cross-Site Scripting" earlier in this chapter), and limit the cookie lifetime as described in the next recommendation.</p>
      <p>To provide privacy and integrity for the cookie, set the <strong>protection</strong> attribute on the <strong>&lt;forms&gt;</strong> element as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>&lt;forms protection="All"    Privacy and integrity&amp;nbsp;</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>A secure &lt;<strong>forms</strong>&gt; element configuration is shown here:</p>
      <pre>&lt;forms loginUrl="Secure\Login.aspx"<br />       protection="All"<br />       requireSSL="true"<br />       timeout="00:30:00" <br />       slidingExpiration="true"<br />       name="YourAppName"<br />       path="/Secure" /&gt;</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Always use stored procedures when interacting with a database. This increases performance and reduces the risk of a successful SQL injection attack.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Attackers can use a SQL Injection Attack to manipulate the database in unforeseen ways. SQL injection allows an attacker to assume the credentials of the SQL account used to connect to the database, which may lead to arbitrary reading, writing, updating, or deleting of data. In an improperly secured database this can also lead to remote code execution through the use of certain stored procedures that allow for direct Operating System command injection.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Whenever interaction with a database is required</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>First the stored procedure will have to be created on the database, this can be done using the following SQL syntax:</p>
  <pre>CREATE PROCEDURE <br />sp_AddNewUser( @UserName nvarchar(255), @Email  nvarchar(255), <br />@FirstName nvarchar(255), @LastName nvarchar(255)) AS</pre>
  <pre>-- INSERT the new user<br />INSERT INTO Users_Table(UserName, Email, FirstName, LastName)<br />VALUES(@UserName, @Email, @FirstName, @LastName)<br />--This will return the new user’s IDSELECT SCOPE_IDENTITY()</pre>
  <p>Now to call the stored procedure we can use the following .NET code:</p>
  <pre>//create a new connection using our connection string<br />SqlConnection myConnection = new SqlConnection(connection string)<br />;myConnection.Open();<br />//create a new command that specifies our store procedure<br />SqlCommand myCommand = new SqlCommand("sp_AddNewUser", myConnection);<br />//Specify our command is a stored proceduremy<br />Command.CommandType = Command<br />Type.StoredProcedure;<br />//Create a new parameter to carry the username<br />SqlParameter UserParameter = new SqlParameter("@UserName", SqlDbType.VarChar);<br />UserParameter.Direction = ParameterDirection.Input;<br />UserParameter.Value = "TestUser";<br />//Add the parameter to the command<br />myCommand.Parameters.Add(UserParameter);<br />//Repeat this code to add commands for each parameter in the SPROC<br />//Execute the command on the Database<br />myCommand.ExecuteNonQuery();</pre>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>There are many ways to create a SQL injection vulnerability, and it’s even possible to do using stored procedures. The vulnerability lies in dynamically creating a SQL statement without bound parameters. In the following example the developer has built the SELECT statement by appending the components of the statements together with user provided input.</p>
  <p>The developer wants to execute the following command where [username] is the username of the user whose e-mail we would like to return</p>
  <pre>SELECT Email from Users_Table where <br />UserName = [username];<br /></pre>
  <pre>The following code will create that statement an execute it on the database:<br />//create a new connection using our connection string<br />SqlConnection myConnection = new SqlConnection(connection string);<br />myConnection.Open();<br />//create a new command that specifies our store procedure<br />string selectCommand = "SELECT Email from Users_Table WHERE UserName = "<br />         + userNameBox.Text;<br />SqlCommand myCommand = new SqlCommand(selectCommand);<br />//Execute the command on the Database<br />SqlDataReader myReader = myCommand.ExecuteReader();</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>First a stored procedure needs to be created on the database, the following SQL syntax can be used to create the same select statement as above:</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use an encrypted communication channel to protect data sent between servers.&amp;nbsp;The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol can be used to secure the communication link between&amp;nbsp;servers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Servers rarely co-exist in a secure environment.&amp;nbsp;Eavesdropping and spoofing are threats when two or more entities must communicate over an untrusted medium such as the public internet, or even&amp;nbsp;a LAN. Using SSL&amp;nbsp;prevents&amp;nbsp;attackers from&amp;nbsp;monitoring the network connection to obtain authentication credentials in plain text. Not using SSL could allow an attacker&amp;nbsp;to capture the authentication cookies&amp;nbsp;and gain spoofed access to&amp;nbsp;any applications that transmit data over the network.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If&amp;nbsp;communicating&amp;nbsp;servers are not inside a physically secure data center where the network eavesdropping threat is negligible,&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;is important to use an encrypted communication channel to protect data sent between servers. SSL is used when an application does not trust other applications on a server. Use SSL when granular channel protection for a particular application running on a server is needed&amp;nbsp;rather than&amp;nbsp;for all applications and services. It is also an appropriate choice when fixed ip addresses are not available. SSL only works with TCP/IP communication&amp;nbsp;protocol as well as named pipes.</p>
  <p>Use IPSec to help protect the communication channel between two servers and to restrict which computers can communicate with one another. For example, you can help protect a database server by establishing a policy that permits requests only from a trusted client computer such as an application or Web server. You can also restrict communication to specific IP protocols and TCP/UDP ports.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Here is how to use SSL&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;protect communication between servers:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Install a Server Authentication Certificate on the server. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Install the Issuing CA's certificate&amp;nbsp;so the&amp;nbsp;two communicating applications may negotiate an SSL connection.&amp;nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Use the "https://" connection protocol in the code to ensure traffic between the 2 server applications are encrypted.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Verify that Communication Is Encrypted. Use Network Monitor to verify that data sent between the application server and database server is encrypted. Start by sending data in clear text form and then enable encryption first by configuring the server and then by configuring the client.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An e-commerce application written in ASP.NET enables customers to pay their bills online through a unified broker. The application's web component&amp;nbsp;relies on an independant&amp;nbsp;account management system that resides on another server. The web&amp;nbsp;component communicates with the account management system using a SQL&amp;nbsp;socket connection.&amp;nbsp; The two servers&amp;nbsp;are located in a competitively priced data center that houses a number of other customers, all of which are able&amp;nbsp;to access the building&amp;nbsp;at all times. A malicious user&amp;nbsp;purchases hosting services at the same company, and&amp;nbsp;after exploring the hosting environment, learns that the hosted accounts are networked using a shared&amp;nbsp;bus topology&amp;nbsp;that allows for network snooping. The attacker is able to setup a sniffer, and captures all of the communication between the account management component and the web component, since SQL connections are not encrypted by default. The attacker can now log in as a legitimate user&amp;nbsp;on the account management server and make changes at will.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>An e-commerce application written in ASP.NET enables customers to pay their bills online through a unified broker. The application's web component&amp;nbsp;relies on an independant&amp;nbsp;account management system that resides on another server. The web&amp;nbsp;component communicates with the account management system using a SQL&amp;nbsp;socket connection. The two servers&amp;nbsp;are located in a competitively priced data center that houses a number of other customers, all of which are able&amp;nbsp;to access the building&amp;nbsp;at all times. The Developer of the application setup encrypted SSL traffic by installing a Server Authenticaion Certificate on the machine hosting the account management component, and installed the issuing CA's certificate on the&amp;nbsp;server hosting the web component. &amp;nbsp;The components use OLE-DB to communicate, so the developer inserted the following configuration directives in the web.config file:</p>
  <pre>"Provider=SQLOLEDB.1;Integrated Security=SSPI;Persist Security <br />&amp;nbsp; Info=False;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Data Source=sql01;Use <br />&amp;nbsp; Encryption for Data=True"</pre>
  <p>The developer then uses the following call to connect to the database using the SSL tunnel for data encryption:</p>
  <pre>// Replace the server name in the following connection string with the name of your database <br />serverSqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("server='sql01';<br />  database=NorthWind;IntegratedSecurity='SSPI'");</pre>
  <p>Because&amp;nbsp;traffic between the two components is encrypted, the transmission medium&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;less&amp;nbsp;likely to affect the ability of the two components to communicate securely.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Encode all input that is displayed back to the user.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Proper encoding of echoed input prevents injection attacks such as cross-site scripting.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If user input will be echoed back to the client in any way, encode it before displaying it. This includes input that is immediately echoed back as well as input that is stored first (such as in a database) before being echoed back later.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Encoding the echoed user input prevents injection attacks such as cross-site scripting. Use the following steps to ensure all echoed input is encoded:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all echoed input. </strong>Locate all places inside your application where user-supplied data will be returned to the client. Such data can be of a reflective or persistent nature:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Reflective</strong>: In a reflective setting, the input is immediately returned to the client. For example, search engines present the searched query when displaying the results. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Persistent</strong>: In a persistent setting, the input is stored and returned to the client when retrieved from the database. For example, message boards store the users' posts inside a database and return them when a given topic is viewed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Determine the&amp;nbsp;type of encoding. </strong>After identifying all echoed input, determine how the input is returned to client. Data is said to be in a HTML context when that data is rendered as a part of a HTML document and is understood by the browser to be HTML. There are other contexts available to Web Applications, such as JavaScript context, CSS context, etc. Data is said to be in a JavaScript context when it is included in JavaScript code and is interpreted as JavaScript by the browser, and so on. Data has to be encoded differently for different contexts to prevent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. The differences of encoding arise from the fact that different contexts have different special symbols and keywords. Output encoding routines have to be designed with the understanding of the context of the output in mind.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>URL encoding</strong>: URL encoding allows your application to maintain the original URL, yet display it to the user in a non-malicious way. Because HTTP headers allow a substitution schema, all characters/symbols are preserved by displaying their ASCII codes instead of the actual character/symbol. For example, <em>&lt;</em> is represented by <em>%3C</em> where <em>3C</em> is the ASCII value for <em>&lt;</em>:</p>
          <pre>String encodedUrl = URLEncoder.encode(url);</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>HTML encoding</strong>: HTML encoding is used when the echoed input is returned as regular text or HTML content. Input should be encoded by substituting certain characters with their respective HTML values.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>HTML Attribute Encoding</strong>: HTML Attribute encoding is used to encode dynamic data that is output in an attribute of an HTML tag, except&amp;nbsp;URL, CSS, and JavaScript event handler attributes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>JavaScript Encoding</strong>: JavaScript encoding is used to encode dynamic data that is output into the JavaScript context, including certain event handlers in HTML tags.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>CSS Encoding</strong>: CSS encoding is used to encode dynamic data that is output into the CSS context.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>DOM Encoding</strong>: DOM encoding is used to encode dynamic data that is used in situations where the DOM is involved. These instances are more complicated and often involve multiple output contexts, which necessitates chaining in many circumstances.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Apply the encoding. </strong>After identifying the echoed input and determining the appropriate encoding method, apply the encoding before the input is returned to the client. There are different encoding libraries available. Different libraries have different capabilities and weaknesses. Please refer to the vendor's documentation for each potential encoding library.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code produces a data analysis based on a financial index. Because it does not HTML encode the echoed input, the application is vulnerable to reflective cross-site scripting.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Enumerate the different types of users and create specific roles for them. When authorizing access to a resource, build the security checks on a per-role basis rather than on a per-user basis.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Application roles allow administrators to group users into categories that need the same level of privileges. The mechanism provides an easy and clear way to discover and manage the least privileges necessary for the execution of a given task. It provides a more robust and flexible way of managing the application's users.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application uses access control and authorizes its users to application resources.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To apply this concept access control should be based on a user's role rather than the actual user.</p>
  <p>Use the following steps when designing the role-based security:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Understand the different types of users</strong>: Enumerate the different types of users needed for the application. Understand how they willl use the application and to which resources they will need access. Create a spreadsheet mapping the actions each role is authorized to perform with the corresponding system components. Use this spreadsheet to identify the different types of users according to the functionality they need. Creating a threat model may be a useful step to ensure that you correctly understand the implications of this matrix.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Establish the roles</strong>: Define which resources can be accessed by each role. There are two approaches when enforcing role-based security - programmatic and declarative.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>

            <strong>Programmatically</strong>: The programmatic approach to role-based security is written inside the code and provides additional runtime flexibility. It allows your application to dynamically create and assign roles so that user privileges can be granted and revoked without the need of restarting your application. When using the programmatic approach to role-based security, place access control checks at the appropriate locations in your application. For example, the following code requires users to be shareholders in order to generate a financial report:</p>
          <pre>public void GenerateFinancialReport(DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate)<br />{<br />    if (HttpContext.Current.User.IsInRole("ShareHolders"))<br />    {<br />        // Generate the relevant financial report<br />    }<br />}</pre>
          <p>Additionally, your application can programmatically check if a user is member of a local Windows group.</p>
          <pre>public void RetrieveLogs(ref Hashtable logTable)<br />{<br />    WindowsPrincipal user = new WindowsPrincipal((WindowsIdentity)HttpContext.Current.User.Identity);<br />    if (user.IsInRole(WindowsBuiltInRole.Administrator))<br />    {<br />        // Add logic for retrieving logs<br />    }<br />}</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Declarative</strong>: The declarative approach to role-based security is done via the configuration files. It allows easy manageability as the declarations can be modified without having to recompile. By using the declarative approach, you can easily manage the security settings for large portions of the application without changing the source code. ASP.NET applications that use declarative security specify the appropriate roles inside <strong>web.config</strong>. The following elements enforce role-based security through <strong>web.config</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>roleManager</strong>: Configures the ASP.NET role manager. Applicable only if form-based authentication is used. Example:</p>
              <pre>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;<br />  &lt;add name="MyAppSqlConnection"<br />       connectionString="Server=serv02.example.com; Database=myapp; Integrated Security=SSPI;"<br />       providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/&gt;<br /> ...<br /> &lt;system.web&gt;<br />   &lt;roleManager enabled="true" cacheRolesInCookie="false" defaultProvider ="ProjectRoleProvider"&gt;<br />    &lt;providers&gt;<br />      &lt;clear /&gt;<br />      &lt;add name="MyAppRoleProvider"<br />            type="System.Web.Security.SqlRoleProvider"<br />            connectionStringName="MyAppSqlConnection"<br />            applicationName="MyApp"/&gt;</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>authorization</strong>: Encapsulates the authorization settings for a resource.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>allow</strong>: Represents the users and roles that are allowed access to the given resource.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>deny</strong>: Represents the users and roles that are denied access to the given resource.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <pre>&lt;!-- web.config --&gt;<br />&lt;system.web&gt;<br />   &lt;authentication mode="Windows" /&gt;<br />   &lt;authorization&gt;<br />    &lt;allow roles="BUILTIN\Administrators"/&gt;<br />    &lt;deny users="*"/&gt;<br />  &lt;/authorization&gt;<br />&lt;/system.web&gt;</pre>
          <p>Additionally, if your application uses form-based authentication, you can configure your application's access controls through Visual Studio's ASP.NET Configuration, available by accessing the <strong>Website -&gt; ASP.NET Configuration</strong> menu.</p>
          <p>Note that if you use Windows authentication, you will need to manage your application's users and user roles through managing Windows users and groups.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Manage the users</strong>: Assign the users into their respective user roles. The application should enforce the security policy according to the user roles instead of the actual user. Based on your application's mechanism to enforce role-based access controls, use one of the following techniques to manage your application's users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Programmatically</strong>: ASP.NET allows you to manage your application's users through the <strong>Roles</strong> class.</p>
          <p>Use the following methods to assign users into roles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>AddUserToRole</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AddUserToRoles</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AddUsersToRole</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AddUsersToRoles</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre>Roles.AddUserToRole("eric", "ShareHolders");</pre>
          <p>Use the following methods to remove users from roles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>RemoveUserFromRole</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>RemoveUserFromRoles</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>RemoveUsersFromRole</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>RemoveUsersFromRoles</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre>Roles.RemoveUserFromRole("eric", "ShareHolders");</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Declarative</strong>: Use the ASP.NET Role Manager to manage your application's users. If your application uses form-based authentication, you can configure your application's access controls through Visual Studio's ASP.NET Configuration, available by accessing the <strong>Website -&gt; ASP.NET Configuration</strong> menu.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Windows</strong>: If your application uses Windows authentication, use the Windows <strong>Local Users and Groups</strong> service to manage your application's users. If your server is connected to your organization's NT Domain or Active Directory forest, user and role management will be performed by your organization's network administrators.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment illustrates an application's access control policy. Because the application does not enforce role-based security, it has a policy entry for each separate user; therefore managing the users' access rights can be quite difficult when the number of users to the application grows.</p>
  <pre>&lt;authorization&gt;<br />  &lt;allow users="NTDomain\joe, NTDomain\sarah, NTDomain\bill, NTDomain\sue"/&gt;<br />  &lt;deny users="*"/&gt;<br />&lt;/authorization&gt;</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment illustrates an application's access control policy. Because the application enforces role-based security, it provides a policy entry for each group of users; therefore increasing the application's users has no impact on the ability to manage the users' access rights as only the group permissions need to be modified.</p>
  <pre>&lt;authorization&gt;<br />  &lt;allow roles="NTDomain\Employees"/&gt;<br />  &lt;deny users="*"/&gt;<br />&lt;/authorization&gt;</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Validate all input before it is passed to the database.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Unvalidated input can lead to persistent cross-site scripting, SQL injection and other vulnerabilities which would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application uses a backend database server, then validate all input before it is passed to the database.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To properly validate input passed to database:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Identify database entry points. </strong>Identify all locations within your application that interface with the database servers. Potential sources of input include: <ul><li>URL-based parameters </li><li>Form-based parameters </li><li>Hidden fields </li><li>Cookies </li><li>Local filesystem </li><li>Javascript variables</li></ul></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Create a set of validators. </strong>Build a set of validators that work with the database-specific language. Determine the appropriate validation at each validator. Centralize the validators as it helps strengthen your code by limiting the amount of scattered validation code throughout the component. Place the validators along the database entry points. All data should pass through the validators before transmitted to the database servers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use type safe SQL parameters in queries. </strong>Stored procedures and parameterized queries improve your application's robustness against SQL injection based attacks.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code allows the user to query a database. Unfortunately, the application fails to validate the user's input; therefore, an attacker can access the backend database on behalf of the application through the use of SQL injection. </p>
  <pre>public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,<br />     HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException{<br />     PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();<br />     String query = request.getParameter("query");<br />     String retData = "";<br /><br />     // The application fails to validate the user-supplied<br />     // query before submitting it to the database server<br />     retData = queryDB(query);<br /><br />     ...<br /><br />     out.flush();<br />     out.close();<br />}</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code allows the user to query a database. Because the application validates the user's input, it is much more difficult for an attacker to access the backend database through a SQL injection attack.</p>
  <pre>public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,<br />     HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException{<br />     PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();<br />     String query = request.getParameter("query");<br />     String retData = "";<br /><br />     // The application validates the user-supplied query<br />     // before submitting it to the database server<br />     if (validateQuery(query))<br />     {<br />          retData = queryDB(query);<br /><br />          ...<br /><br />     }<br /><br />     out.flush();<br />     out.close();<br />}<br /><br /><br />public boolean validateQuery(String input){<br /><br />      // The input can be only of numeric characters<br />      String goodPattern = "[0-9]++";<br /><br />      Pattern p = Pattern.compile(goodPattern);<br />      Matcher m = p.matcher(input);<br /><br />      if(!m.matches())<br />      {<br />            return false;<br />      }<br /><br />      return true;<br />}</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>When passing sensitive data over the network, check that the data is either encrypted by the application or that the data is only passed over encrypted communication links.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Sensitive data passed across the network to and from the database server may include application specific data or database login credentials. To ensure the privacy and integrity of data over the network, either use a platform-level solution (such as that provided by a secure datacenter where IPSec encrypted communication channels are used between servers) or configure your application to establish SSL connections to the database.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>When you pass sensitive data over the network, make sure it remains private and unaltered.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If you are sending sensitive data over the network to the client, encrypt the data or secure the channel. A common practice is to use SSL between the client and Web server. Between servers, an increasingly common approach is to use IPSec. For securing sensitive data that flows through several intermediaries, for example, Web service Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages, use message level encryption.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Reduce the lifetime of sessions to mitigate the risk of session hijacking and replay attacks.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Even when using SSL, there's still&amp;nbsp;a risk of session hijacking and replay; there are lots of other out-of-band ways to steal session tokens.&amp;nbsp; The shorter the session timeout, however, the less time an attacker has to capture a session cookie and use it to access your application.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All applications should consider the length of their sessions carefully, and any application protecting any sensitive information should make it as short as possible.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>There are two pieces of information that need to be handled to limit the session lifetime.&amp;nbsp; The first is the actual session cookie and the second is the server side session state.&amp;nbsp; With most frameworks, each time the user takes an action on the site the timestamps on the session cookie&amp;nbsp;and the corresponding field in the server-side session state&amp;nbsp;are both reset to the current time.&amp;nbsp; If someone attempts to use an expired cookie, the timestamp in the server-side session state for that session is checked and the request is disallowed.&amp;nbsp; If the session is old enough that the server-side state has been deleted, it's denied immediately.&amp;nbsp; In web farms, the timestamp may be embedded in the cookie and cryptographically signed, freeing up servers from the need to keep a single explicit session-state table.</p>
  <p>Most web application frameworks will handle the details for you, so you'll only need to specify a simple timeout value.&amp;nbsp; In some situations, you'll be able to choose whether the session timer should reset after each action (an idle timer, the default) or if it should be a single fixed timer from the initial login (an absolute timer).&amp;nbsp; The latter is useful for fast transactions and especially security critical situations.</p>
  <p>For most situations, thirty minutes is the maximum that an idle session should be accepted.&amp;nbsp; For sites which handle sensitive information, ten minutes is more appropriate.&amp;nbsp; If you want to allow a user to browse a site and let sessions sit for long periods of time and retain a customized experience, you can seperate out the cookies that control site customization from those that control access to more sensitive information or functionality; the customization cookies can be persisted while the actual session is expired.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>A web site uses the default (one hour) session time set by their web application framework.&amp;nbsp; When a user in an internet cafe forgets to log off, an attacker using the machine after them can browse to the site and use the old session to gain access to the victim's sensitive information.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>A web site locks down its session timeouts to ten minutes, overriding the default set by their web application framework.&amp;nbsp; When a user in an internet cafe forgets to log off, an attacker using the machine after them cannot browse to the site and use the old session to gain access to the victim's sensitive information, because the session has already expired.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Store passwords in a secure fashion. Do not store in plain text or use an easy-to-crack encryption or obfuscation scheme.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Storing passwords in plaintext or using weak encryption can aid an attacker when stealing them. Compromised passwords may aid an attacker into accessing, modifying and deleting sensitive data.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to store passwords securely:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose user-identifiable data. </strong>User-identifiable data will be used to generate a secure key. This data should be tied to the user's account, and it should be different for every user. For example, a valid email address would fit into this category. If your application uses the email address approach, confirm that the address is real and verify that no&amp;nbsp;two users are sharing an email address.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Generate the&amp;nbsp;key. </strong>Use the user-identifiable data and some random salt to generate the key. Because encryption key sizes need to be 256 bit, it is recommended to generate the key by hashing the user-identifiable data with some random salt. This technique makes it impossible for an attacker to obtain the encryption key&amp;nbsp;unless he also&amp;nbsp;obtains your application's random salt.<br /><br />Make sure that you securely clean-up all instances of the generated encryption key as it can help an attacker compromise the protected password if the key is exposed.&amp;nbsp;Example of generating an encryption key:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>byte[] salt = MyApp.generateSalt();<br />String userMail = myapp@example.com;<br />MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-512");<br />md.update(userMail.getBytes("UTF-8"));<br />md.update(salt);<br />byte[] rawKey = md.digest();<br />md.reset();</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If your application uses a randomly generated salt, make sure that your application encrypts the random salt and stores it into a configuration file. Always use <strong>SecureRandom</strong> and not <strong>Random</strong> to generate the salt. Example of using <strong>SecureRandom</strong> to generate a random salt:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>public static byte[] generateSalt() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException<br />{<br />      // Note that salt is declared as private static byte[] and is<br />      // initialized to null.<br />       if (salt == null)<br />      {<br />            SecureRandom srand = SecureRandom.getInstance("SHA1PRNG");<br />                          salt = new byte[4];<br />            srand.nextBytes(salt);<br />      }<br />       return salt;<br />}</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose an&amp;nbsp;appropriate encryption function. </strong>Choose a strong symmetric encryption algorithm that will not be easy for an attacker to break; such as AES.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>byte[] salt = MyApp.generateSalt();<br />String userMail = myapp@example.com;<br />MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-512");<br />md.update(userMail.getBytes("UTF-8"));<br />md.update(salt);<br />byte[] rawKey = md.digest();<br />md.reset();<br />SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(rawKey, "AES");<br />// Set up cipherCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");<br />cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, skeySpec);<br />// Note that pass is declared as byte[] and contains the user's password<br />byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(pass);</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Because of import control restrictions, Java initially ships with a limited set of cryptography. To fully utilize Java's crypto strength, it is recommended to install the "Unlimited Strength" Jurisdiction Policy Files.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Never store the user credentials or their encrypted values on the client side (e.g. in cookies, hidden fields, etc.). Use sessions when there is a need to track the user or to&amp;nbsp;store their encrypted credentials. For more information, consult the Session Management section.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code authenticates a user based on a username and password. The supplied credentials are compared to the credentials stored in the backend database. Unfortunately, the credentials in the database are in plaintext and could be stolen if the database is compromised.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />      // Query the credential store with the provided credentials<br />      ...<br />}</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code validates the user based on a&amp;nbsp;given username and password. It uses the user's valid email address and a random salt to encrypt the user's password. Then it compares the username and the produced digest against the data stored in the backend database. Therefore, the password is stored encrypted in the database.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />       ...<br />       // Encrypt the credentials<br />      try<br />      {<br />            userEmail = MyApp.getEmailForUser(user);<br />            passDigest = encryptCredentials(userEmail, pass, salt);<br />      }<br />      catch (GeneralSecurityException gse)<br />      {<br />            // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms<br /><br />            return false;<br />      }<br />      catch (IOException ioe)<br />      {<br />            // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms<br />            return false;<br />      }<br />       // Query the credential store and execute the rest of the authentication steps<br />      ...<br />}<br />public static byte[] encryptCredentials(String email, char[] pass, byte[] salt)<br />       throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException<br />{<br />      MessageDigest md;<br />      byte[] tempPass;<br />      byte[] rawKey;<br />      // Generate encryption key<br />      md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-512");<br />      md.update(email.getBytes("UTF-8"));<br />      md.update(salt);<br />      rawKey = md.digest();<br />      md.reset();<br />      SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(rawKey, "AES");<br />      // Set up cipher<br />      Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");<br />      cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, skeySpec);<br />      // Convert char[] to byte[]<br />      tempPass = new byte[pass.length];<br />      for (int i = 0; i &lt; pass.length; i++)<br />      {<br />            tempPass[i] = (byte)pass[i];<br />      }<br />      // Encrypt password<br />      byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(tempPass);<br />            //Clean tempPass<br />      for (int i = 0; i &lt; tempPass.length; i++)<br />      {<br />            tempPass[i] = 0;<br />      }<br />      return encrypted;<br />}</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use mapping values to perform redirects or forwards based on user input.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using mapping values when performing redirects or forwards prevents malicious users from creating hyperlinks that use the redirects or forwards to point to pages other than those intended by the application design.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Use this guideline when writing a web application that uses redirects or forwards. Avoid using redirects or forwards in web applications, if possible.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to calculate destinations of redirects and forwards based on mapping values:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify redirects and forwards.</strong> Review code to find all redirects and forwards.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enumerate destinations.</strong> Make a list of all destinations pointed to by redirects and forwards.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define mapping values.</strong> Define mapping values for all destinations used by redirects and forwards. A mapping value is a short identifying string that symbolically represents a resource.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Rewrite redirects and forwards.</strong> Rewrite redirects and forwards to use mapping values as input to calculate the final destinations of redirects or forwards.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>Consider an on-line banking application that has an insecure redirect:</p>
  <pre>http://www.onlinebank.com/redirect.asp?url=[destination]</pre>
  <p>A phisher may create the following hyperlink to point to his own site and send it in spam messages to millions of people:</p>
  <pre>http://www.onlinebank.com/redirect.asp?url=www.phisher.com</pre>
  <p>When a user sees a link that appears to point to his bank at onlinebank.com in an e-mail message, he clicks that link and sees a web site that looks exactly like the bank's, but is actually a phishing web site used to steal authentication credentials. The user enters his account number and PIN into the web page, receives an error message telling him to try again, and is redirected to the bank's real site. After entering his credentials again, the user successfuly views his account. However, the phisher now has the user's online banking information.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The simplest solution&amp;nbsp;is to get rid of the redirect altogether, but if it is necessary for application design, then mapping values may be used to mitigate this vulnerability. For example, if redirect.asp is used by the application to redirect to balance.asp, a mapping value called "balance" may be created to signify balance.asp. The page redirect.asp should then be rewritten to accept mapping values as input, instead of urls. The following url should then redirect to balance.asp:</p>
  <pre>http://www.onlinebank.com/redirect.asp?map=balance</pre>
  <p>However, the following malicious hyperlink will no longer work, because supplied input will not match any mapping value defined in the application:</p>
  <pre>http://www.onlinebank.com/redirect.asp?url=www.phisher.com</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Validate all input before it is passed to the database.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Unvalidated input can lead to persistent cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and other vulnerabilities which would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application uses a backend database server.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To properly validate input passed to database:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify application inputs. </strong>Potential sources of input include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>URL based parameters </li>
        <li>Form based parameters </li>
        <li>Hidden fields </li>
        <li>Cookies </li>
        <li>Local filesystem </li>
        <li>Javascript variables</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify database entry points.</strong> Find all the locations in the system where data is pushed into the database, either directly via queries, or indirectly (via log entries, etc). Trace all database entry points to find all the paths which can contain external input.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Create a set of validators:</strong> Build a set of validators that work with the data in question and fit into the system architecture, including your general validation scheme for other data and the way the system interacts with the database. Using the Validate Input for Length, Range, Format, and Type guideline, determine the appropriate validation at each validator. Centralize the validators as it helps strengthen your code by limiting the amount of scattered validation code throughout the system, and allows for easy auditing. Place the validators along the database input paths, ideally as close to the initial data input as possible. All data should pass through the validators before breing transmitted to the database servers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use Type-Safe parameters in SQL statements:</strong> Stored procedures and Parameterized queries improve your application's robustness against SQL injection based attacks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Audit your entry paths.</strong> Before going into production, have a reviewer who was not responsible for the development of the code in question check all the input paths to ensure that the validators are correctly implemented, that they are correctly applied, and that all input paths are checked.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code validates the user based on a given username and password. It hashes the password with a random salt. Then it compares the username and the produced hash against the data stored in the backend database. Unfortunately, the SQL query is dynamically crafted by using the user's input. If there is no proper input validation, an attacker can access the application's database server through the use of SQL injection.</p>
  <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />      byte[] salt = MyApp.generateSalt();<br />      String passHash;<br />      SqlConnection cn;<br />      SqlCommand sqlCommand;<br />      String query;<br />      passHash = hashCredentials(pass, salt);<br />      // The application crafts the SQL query based on user's input<br />      cn = MyApp.getDBConnection();<br />      sqlCommand = new SqlCommand("select user from myappUsers where user = \""<br /><br />      + user + "\" and pass = \"" + passHash + "\" and login_attempts &lt; 3;", cn);<br />      SqlDataReader reader = sqlCommand.ExecuteReader();<br />      updateLastLoginAttempt(user);<br />      ...<br />}</pre>
  <p>If a user submits a login request with a username of 'foo\" or 1 = 1; drop table *; --', the system will happily first authenticate the user and then drop all the tables in the database.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code validates the user based on a given username and password. It hashes the password with a random salt. Then it compares the username and the produced hash against the data stored in the backend database. Because the application uses the Parameters property, it is much more difficult for an attacker to gain access to the application's database server through the use of SQL injection. </p>
  <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />   byte[] salt = MyApp.generateSalt();<br />   String passHash; <br />   SqlConnection cn;<br />   SqlCommand sqlCommand;<br />   String query;     <br />   passHash = hashCredentials(pass, salt);<br />   // The application crafts the SQL query based on user's input<br />   cn = MyApp.getDBConnection();<br />   sqlCommand = new SqlCommand("select user from myappUsers where user = @user and <br />                    + pass = @passHash and login_attempts &lt; 3;", cn);<br />   sqlCommand.Parameters.Add("@user", SqlDbType.VarChar, user.Length).Value = user;<br />   sqlCommand.Parameters.Add("@passHash ", SqlDbType.VarChar, passHash.Length).Value = passHash;<br />   SqlDataReader reader = sqlCommand.ExecuteReader(); <br />   updateLastLoginAttempt(user);  <br />   ...<br />}</pre>
  <p>Even if the user passes in an arbitrary string for a username or a password, they will not be able to alter the query or otherwise effect the database. An even better solution would involve using a stored procedure instead of a parameterized command, because that would permit the database to be locked down further.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Encrypt the communication channels when interacting with other software across the network.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Encrypting the communication links allows the application to preserve confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If sensitive data must be transmitted between two hosts. The transmission could be between servers or between a client and a server.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To encrypt the communication links:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the connections used for transmitting sensitive data.</strong> Enumerate all connections between the different entities. Identify the sensitive data that is sent over the network and the respective connections that are used for such communication. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose the appropriate encryption mechanism.</strong> Depending on the infrastructure, you may consider using IPSec or TLS/SSL.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>IPSec.</strong> IPSec is used when the encryption needs to be applied across all involved parties. Because IPSec is designed to secure connections between static hosts that are "always on", use IPSec to secure the network connections between your application's servers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>TLS/SSL.</strong> TLS/SSL provides granular protection. This allows the traffic containing sensitive data only to be encrypted. Because TLS/SSL has a certificate based design, it allows the protection of data between mobile hosts. Use TLS/SSL to secure the communication channel between your application and its users. While .NET provides APIs for handling SSL encrypted traffic, it is recommended to follow the manuals associated with any third party software that is being used. If your application uses SSL, ensure that you use SSL 3.0 and disable the cryptographically weak SSL 2.0 protocols.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Apply the appropriate encryption mechanism. </strong>Apply the encryption mechanism of choice at the appropriate locations in the code. Such locations include all functionality that establishes a connection between your application and another entity.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code establishes a connection between two servers. Unfortunately, the communication is not encrypted and it is possible for an attacker to eavesdrop on the connection.</p>
  <pre>public Stream Connect(string remoteHost, int remotePort)<br />{<br />    TcpClient client = new TcpClient(remoteHost, remotePort);<br />    NetworkStream netStream = client.GetStream();<br />    return netStream;<br />}</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code establishes a connection between two servers. Because the communication is encrypted the confidentiality of the data in transit is preserved and it is impossible for an attacker to eavesdrop on the connection.</p>
  <pre>public Stream Connect(string remoteHost, int remotePort)<br />{<br />    TcpClient client = new TcpClient(remoteHost, remotePort);<br />    SslStream netStream = new SslStream(client.GetStream(), false,<br />               new RemoteCertificateValidationCallback(this.ValidateSSLCertificate));<br />    try<br />    {<br />        netStream.AuthenticateAsClient(remoteHost);<br />    }<br />    catch (AuthenticationException ae)<br />    {<br />        client.Close();<br />        throw ae;<br />    }<br />    return netStream;<br />}</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use the ASP.NET role manager for role-based authorization instead of writing custom code. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>ASP.NET provides a role manager feature that automatically allows you to create, manage, and look up roles for the currently authenticated user.&amp;nbsp; Role managers reduce possibilities for serious security issues from programmer errors and reduce the amount of custom code needed for an application. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application uses windows authentication&amp;nbsp;or stores roles in SQL server you&amp;nbsp;should use ASP.NET role managers.&amp;nbsp; If you need an authorization scheme or a feature not present in the provided role managers, write a custom role manager instead of an entirely custom authorization scheme so you can leverage the existing interfaces. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Roles are accessed from the configured role store by the <strong>RoleManager</strong> HTTP module by using the configured role provider.&amp;nbsp; This occurs after the user is authenticated but before URL authorization and file authorization access checks occur and before programmatic role checks can occur. </p>
  <p>To use the role manager feature in an ASP.NET application, you need to do the following: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Add a &lt;<strong>roleManager</strong>&gt; element beneath the &lt;<strong>system.web</strong>&gt; section of your application's Web.config file and enable role manager by setting its <strong>enabled</strong> attribute to <strong>true</strong>. </li>
    <li>Add a connection string to the &lt;<strong>connectionStrings</strong>&gt; section to point to your roles store. If you are using the <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong>, this is an LDAP query string pointing to your Authorization Manager Policy store in Active Directory or ADAM. If you are using the <strong>SqlRoleProvider</strong>, this is a database connection string that points to your role store database. </li>
    <li>Configure the specific provider in the &lt;<strong>roleManager</strong>&gt;<strong></strong>element in your application's Web.config file. The role manager system supports the following providers: </li>
    <li>If your application roles are in an Authorization Manager Policy store in Active Directory or ADAM, use the <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong>. </li>
    <li>If your application roles are in a SQL Server database, use the <strong>SqlRoleProvider.</strong></li>
    <li>If your application uses Windows groups as roles, use the <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong>. Note that this is recommended to be used with Windows Authentication only. </li>
    <li>If your application roles are in a store other than those previously listed, create a custom roles provider inheriting <strong>RoleProvider</strong> base class. </li>
    <li>Set the <strong>defaultProvider</strong> attribute on the &lt;<strong>roleManager</strong>&gt; element to the chosen role provider. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>To check roles and manage roles, use the Role Manager API (for example <strong>Roles.IsUserInRole </strong>and <strong>Roles.CreateRole</strong>). </p>
  <p>If your application needs role-based authorization, use the following guidelines: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use role providers to perform role authorization.</strong>&amp;nbsp; Role providers allow you to load the roles for users without writing and maintaining code.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the role providers offer a consistent way for you to check the role membership of your users, regardless of the underlying data store.&amp;nbsp; Where possible, use one of the supplied roles providers; these include <strong>SqlRoleProvider</strong>, <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong>, and <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong>.&amp;nbsp; If you already have a custom role store in a non-SQL Server database or in a non-Active Directory LDAP store, consider implementing your own custom role provider. </p>
      <p>The following code shows how to use the role manager API and specifically <strong>Roles.IsUserInRole</strong>. </p>
      <pre>// Tests whether the currently authenticated user is a member<br />// of a particular role.<br />if(Roles.IsUserInRole("Manager"))<br />   // Perform restricted operation else<br />   // Return unauthorized access error.<br />// Tests whether any given user is a member of a role:<br />if(Roles.IsUserInRole("Bob","Manager"))<br />   // Perform restricted operation<br />else<br />   // Return unauthorized access error.</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use the SqlRoleProvider when your roles are in SQL Server.</strong>&amp;nbsp; If you store role information in SQL Server, configure your application to use the <strong>SqlRoleProvider</strong>.&amp;nbsp; You can also configure forms authentication with the <strong>SqlMembershipProvider</strong> to use the same database for authentication and authorization, although this is not required. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use the WindowsTokenRoleProvider when you use Windows groups as roles.</strong>&amp;nbsp; If your application uses Windows authentication and you use Windows groups as roles, configure your application to use the <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use the AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider when your application roles are in ADAM.</strong>&amp;nbsp; If your application uses Windows authentication against Active Directory, and you need application specific roles instead of using your domain Windows group membership, you can store role information in SQL Server or in an Authorization Manager (AzMan) policy store in ADAM.&amp;nbsp; Authorization Manager provides a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, to create and manage roles, and to manage role membership for users. </p>
      <p>If your user accounts are in Active Directory, but you cannot use Windows authentication and must use forms authentication, a good solution for roles management is to use the <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong> with an AzMan policy store in ADAM. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong> does not directly support Authorization Manager business logic such as operations and tasks. To do this, you must use P/Invoke and call the Authorization Manager API directly. &amp;nbsp;</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>You should Partition your Web Site so that secure pages that require authenticated access are placed in a subdirectory that is separate from the anonymously accessible pages.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>To prevent unauthenticated users from accessing the restricted pages.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your Web application requires users to complete authentication before they can access specific pages, make sure that the restricted pages are placed in a separate directory away from publicly accessible pages. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <h3>Separate Public and Restricted Areas</h3>
  <p>A public area of your site can be accessed by any user anonymously. Restricted areas can be accessed only by specific individuals and the users must authenticate with the site. Consider a typical retail Web site. You can browse the product catalog anonymously. When you add items to a shopping cart, the application identifies you with a session identifier. Finally, when you place an order, you perform a secure transaction. This requires you to log in to authenticate your transaction over SSL.</p>
  <p>By partitioning your site into public and restricted access areas, you can apply separate authentication and authorization rules across the site and limit the use of SSL. To avoid the unnecessary performance overhead associated with SSL, design your site to limit the use of SSL to the areas that require authenticated access.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong> If you are using <strong>Server.Transfer</strong> in your application to transfer from an anonymous page to a secure page, the .NET Framework bypasses authentication checks, so code that uses <strong>Server.Transfer</strong> should be verified to ensure that it does not transfer to a secure directory.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Consider Partitioning Your Web Site</strong>
  </p>
  <p>To avoid having to use SSL across your entire site, structure your Web site so that the secure pages that require authenticated access are placed in a subdirectory that is separate from the anonymously accessible pages. This approach is shown in following Figure 1</p>
  <p>
    <img src="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms998310.f01paght00001201(en-us,MSDN.10).gif" style="border:1px solid #000" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Figure - Visual Studio.NET Solution Explorer showing a partitioned Web site</strong>
  </p>
  <p>In Figure 1, secure pages, including the application's login page, are placed in the <strong>Secure</strong> folder beneath the application's virtual root directory. </p>
  <p>
    <strong>To secure pages in a separate subfolder</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>In Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), configure the secure folder to require SSL. This sets the <strong>AccessSSL=true</strong> attribute for the folder in the IIS Metabase. Requests for pages in the secured folders are successful only if HTTPS is used for the request URL. </li>
    <li>Use an &lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; element to ensure that only authenticated users can access secure pages. Place this element beneath the closing &lt;<strong>/system.web</strong>&gt; tag, as shown here. <div><pre>&lt;!-- The secure folder is for authenticated and SSL access only. --&gt;<br />&lt;location path="Secure" &gt;<br />  &lt;system.web&gt;<br />    &lt;authorization&gt;<br />      &lt;deny users="?" /&gt;<br />    &lt;/authorization&gt;<br />  &lt;/system.web&gt;<br />&lt;/location&gt;  </pre></div><p>Additionally, the following configuration ensures that unauthenticated users are allowed to access pages in the application's root directory. Place this configuration in the main &lt;<strong>system.web</strong>&gt; element. </p><pre>&lt;system.web&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;!-- The virtual directory root folder contains general pages.<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Unauthenticated users can view them and they do not need <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; to be secured with SSL. --&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;authorization&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;allow users="*" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/authorization&gt;<br />&lt;/system.web&gt;&amp;nbsp; </pre></li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you use this type of site structure, your application must not rely on the user's identity on the non-SSL pages. In the preceding configuration, no forms authentication ticket is sent for requests for non-SSL pages. As a result, the user is considered anonymous. This has implications for related features, such as personalization, that require the user name.<strong></strong></blockquote>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Treat all input as untrusted data. Validate untrusted data using whitelist techniques to check against known good input.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Unchecked malicious input may lead to integer overflows, injection based attacks, denial of service or information disclosure. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Always validate input. Do not assume that input is good based on origin.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Input can vary in several ways: length, data, type and contents. It is recommended to verify that all of these meet your application's expectations regarding its input.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Validating length</strong>: Validating an input's length suggests that your application should check a string's length or the number of bits in a numeric value. Checking the length can help prevent buffer overflows as well as integer overflows in numeric values. A simple way of validating the numeric value can be done through the use of <em>BigInteger/BigDecimal</em>:<pre>public boolean validateLength(String input)<br />{<br />      if(validateType(input))<br />      {<br />            BigInteger bi = new BigInteger(input);<br /><br />            if(bi.compareTo(BigInteger.valueOf(0)) &gt; -1<br />               &amp;&amp; bi.compareTo(BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MAX_VALUE)) &lt; 1)<br />            {<br />                  return true;<br />            }<br />            else<br />            {<br />                  return false;<br />            }<br />      }<br />      else<br />      {<br />             return false;<br />      }<br />}</pre></li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Validating type</strong>: Validating the input's data type is important when your application expects a specific non-string parameter. Difference in data type can trigger unhandled exceptions that would throw your application into an unknown state. Example for validating that input is of integer value:<pre>public boolean validateType(String input)<br />{<br />      String goodPattern =\\d+;<br />      Pattern p = Pattern.compile(goodPattern);<br />      Matcher m = p.matcher(input);<br />            if(!m.matches())<br />      {<br /><br />            return false;<br />      }<br />      else<br />      {<br />            return true;<br />      }<br />}</pre></li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Validating contents</strong>: Validating the input's contents can be achieved using whitelist and blacklist techniques. The choice between the use of black and white listing is based upon the constraints that are imposed on the input. If the input follows a tight structure and format, then your application can use whitelisting alone to weed out malicious input. If there are unknowns about the input, then a combination of black and white listing must be used. In general, use blacklisting as a backup to whitelisting. Use a spiral-out approach as input is initially validated using whitelist techniques. When whitelisting cannot validate the input, fall back to blacklisting. If blacklist cannot validate, then discard the input. Whitelisting involves the establishment of what is good input to your application. Once good input is defined, your application must compare all input against the established good input. If the input does not resemble good input, your application should discard it. This technique can be implemented using regular expressions. Example:<pre>public boolean validateData(String input)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; String goodPattern = "(\\w|\\d)+";<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; int goodLength = 10;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if(input.length() &gt; goodLength)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return false;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Pattern p = Pattern.compile(goodPattern);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Matcher m = p.matcher(input);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if(!m.matches())<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return false;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; else<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return true;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />}<br /></pre><p /><ul></ul></li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code produces a data analysis based on a financial index. Because the code does not validate its input, the application is vulnerable to SQL injection.</p>
  <pre>import java.io.*;<br />import java.util.*;<br />import java.lang.*;<br />import javax.servlet.*;<br />import javax.servlet.http.*;<br />import java.util.regex.*;<br /><br />public final class DataAggregator extends HttpServlet<br />{<br />      public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)<br />            throws ServletException, IOException<br />      {<br />            PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();<br />            String searchTerm = request.getParameter("index");<br /><br />            String retString;<br /><br />            try<br />            {<br />                  // The application does not validate the user-supplied data<br />                  retString = "The queried index \"";<br />                  retString += encodeHtml(searchTerm); <br />                  retString += "\" produced the following results:&lt;br&gt; ";<br />                  out.println(retString);<br />                  common.aggregateData(out, searchTerm);<br />            }<br /><br />            catch (Exception e)<br />            {<br />                  // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling<br />                  // mechanisms. Consult the Exception Handling and<br />                  // Logging sections<br />                  out.println("We cannot handle your request at the moment."<br />                            + "Please try again later.");<br />            }<br /><br />            out.flush();<br />            out.close();<br />      }<br />  }</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code produces a data analysis based on a financial index. Since the code validates the application's input, the application is secured against SQL injection.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Define&amp;nbsp;the different types of users and create specific roles for them. When authorizing access to a resource, build the security checks on a per-role basis rather than on a per-user basis.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Application roles allow multiple users to play the same role and&amp;nbsp;provides a clear way to manage the privileges necessary for the execution of a given task. It provides a more robust and flexible way of managing the application's users.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application uses access control and authorizes its users to application resources, then define roles and perform role-based security checks.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To apply this concept, the security checks within an application should be executed against a user's role rather than against the actual user.</p>
  <p>Use the following steps when designing the role-based security:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Understand the different types of users</strong>:&amp;nbsp;List the different types of users expected for the application.&amp;nbsp;Define&amp;nbsp;how they will use&amp;nbsp;the application, which resources they will&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;access, and any additional rules that will impact&amp;nbsp;how access will vary. Create a matrix mapping roles to resource by describing what action the role can take with each system asset. Use this matrix to identify the different types of users according to the functionality they need.</p>
      <pre>Role       Actions    Access Controls    Client Accounts<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />Manager    Connect        Always            Always<br />           Read           Always            Always<br />           Use            Always            Occasionally<br />           Modify         Never             Occasionally<br />Employee   Connect        Always            Always<br />           Read           Always            Always<br />           Use            Always            Always<br />           Modify         Never             Never</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Establish the roles</strong>: Define in code how each role can access each resource. There are two approaches when enforcing role-based security - programmatic and declarative:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Programmatically</strong>: The programmatic approach to role-based security is written inside the code and provides additional runtime flexibility.<br /><br />To enforce role-based security, you need to create a security policy for your application. If you implement this&amp;nbsp;approach using&amp;nbsp;Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) policies, you can execute a more focused set of security checks such as whether a user is allowed to access a particular resource or perform a specific action. When building the policy, create a role with associated permissions&amp;nbsp;for each type of user. For example, certain roles would be permitted to access the local filesystem while others would not.<br /></p>
          <pre>grant Principal application.auth.GroupToken "administrators"<br />{<br />  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "AccessApp";<br />  permission java.io.FilePermission “/tmp/myapp/cache”, “read,write”;<br />};<br />grant Principal application.auth.GroupToken "users"<br />{<br />  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "AccessApp";<br />};</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Declarative</strong>: The declarative approach to role-based security is declared within configuration files. While it doesn’t provide much flexibility in the development phase of the code, it allows easy manageability as the declarations can be modified without a recompile. By using the declarative approach, you can easily manage the security settings for&amp;nbsp;large portions of the applications without a need to change the code.<br /><br />Java applications that use declarative security rely on a deployment descriptor (e.g. web.xml). The deployment descriptor uses the following elements for role-based security:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>security-constraint</strong>: Defines the access controls associated with a collection of resources as defined in the <em>web-resource-collection</em> element. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>web-resource-collection</strong>: Encapsulates a collection of resources that share mutual access controls. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>web-resource-name</strong>: Defines the name for the collection of resources. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>url-pattern</strong>: Identifies the URL of a resource that uses the access controls. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>auth-constraint</strong>: Defines the group of user roles that can access the collection of resources identified by the <em>web-resource-collection</em> element. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>role-name</strong>: Defines the roles that can access the collection of resources. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>http-method</strong>: Identifies the HTTP method upon which the access controls will be enforced. For example, your application may enforce access controls for POST requests, but not GET requests. If omitted, the access controls will apply to all HTTP methods. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <pre>&lt;!-- Application's web.xml --&gt;<br />&lt;security-constraint&gt;<br />      &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;<br />            &lt;web-resource-name&gt;Admin Commands&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;<br />            &lt;url-pattern&gt;/admin/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;<br />            &lt;url-pattern&gt;/config.do&lt;/url-pattern&gt;<br />      &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;<br />      &lt;auth-constraint&gt;<br />            &lt;role-name&gt;Admin&lt;/role-name&gt;<br />      &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;<br />&lt;/security-constraint&gt;<br /><br />&lt;login-config&gt;<br />      &lt;auth-method&gt;BASIC&lt;/auth-method&gt;<br />      &lt;realm-name&gt;Admin Realm&lt;/realm-name&gt;<br />&lt;/login-config&gt;<br /><br />&lt;!-- The following needs to be included if the application is to<br />     use form-based authentication --&gt;</pre>
          <p>In web.xml:</p>
          <pre>&lt;login-config&gt;<br />      &lt;auth-method&gt;FORM&lt;/auth-method&gt;<br />      &lt;form-login-config&gt;<br />            &lt;form-login-page&gt;/loginForm.jsp&lt;/form-login-page&gt;<br />            &lt;form-error-page&gt;/loginFailed.html&lt;/form-error-page&gt;<br />      &lt;/form-login-config&gt;<br />&lt;/login-config&gt;</pre>
          <p>In loginForm.jsp:</p>
          <pre>&lt;form method="POST" action="j_security_check"&gt;<br />&lt;input type="text" name="j_username"&gt;<br />&lt;input type="password" name="j_password"&gt;<br />&lt;input type="submit" value="log in"&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
          <p>Because declarative security asks the hosting server to handle authentication and authorization, there is the risk of disclosing connection strings, database credentials, etc.; therefore, use a JAAS LoginModule when using declarative security.<br /><br />Example using Tomcat (if you use a different environment, please consult its manual):</p>
          <pre>      &lt;!-- $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml --&gt;<br />      &lt;!-- JAAS authentication realm --&gt;<br />      &lt;Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.JAASRealm"<br />             appName="AppLoginConfig"<br />             userClassNames="application.auth.GroupToken"<br />             roleClassNames="application.auth.GroupToken"<br />             useContextClassLoader="false"<br />             debug="99"/&gt;</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Manage the users</strong>: Assign the users into their respective user roles. The application should apply the security policy according to the user roles instead of the actual user.</p>
      <pre>GroupToken groupToken = new GroupToken(groupName);<br />if(!subject.getPrincipals().contains(groupToken))<br />{<br />      subject.getPrincipals().add(groupToken);<br />}</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Consider using additional context when making security decisions</strong>: Simple examples include time of day and day of week. For instance, a given user may have no need to login to a system outside of the standard work hours, or even on the weekend. If that user attempts to login or perform some action in the middle of the weekend, it should not be allowed. Another example could be the user's phyisical location. If a user is expected to always use the system from their office in Chicago, but suddenly is connected in Eastern Europe, access should not be allowed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Consider using access control mechanisms provided by frameworks</strong>: Frameworks such as Spring Security (formerly Acegi) and Apache Shiro (formerly JSecurity), as well as others, seek to provide flexible but secure access control mechanisms that integrate neatly with current MVC frameworks and simplify security functionality.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment illustrates a JAAS policy. Because the application does not enforce role-based security, it has a policy entry for each separate user; therefore, changing the users' access rights can be quite difficult as each user needs to be modified individually.</p>
  <pre>grant Principal application.auth.UserToken "joe"<br />{<br />  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "AccessApp";<br />};<br />grant Principal application.auth.UserToken "steve"<br />{<br />  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "AccessApp";<br />};<br />grant Principal application.auth.UserToken "julie" <br />{<br />  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "AccessApp";<br />};</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment illustrates a JAAS policy. Because the application enforces role-based security, it has a policy entry for each group of users; therefore changing the users' access rights is easy as only the group needs to be modified.</p>
  <pre>grant Principal application.auth.GroupToken "users"<br />{<br />  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "AccessApp";<br />};</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Internet Protocol security (IPSec)&amp;nbsp;provides encryption, integrity, and authentication services for IP-based network traffic.&amp;nbsp;Use&amp;nbsp;IPSec to provide server-to-server protection&amp;nbsp;against internal network threats, including eavesdropping, tampering, man in the middle attacks, IP spoofing, and other password-based attacks by restricting which computers can communicate with each other, and limit the protocols they can communicate with.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Servers&amp;nbsp;do not usually co-exist in a secure environment. Eavesdropping and spoofing are threats when two or more entities must communicate over&amp;nbsp;typical untrusted mediums such as the public internet&amp;nbsp;or a company intranet. Failure to use IPSec&amp;nbsp;increases the likleihood&amp;nbsp;that data traveling on the network will be intercepted, modified, or&amp;nbsp;stolen.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>IPSec can be used&amp;nbsp;for the following tasks:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide message confidentiality by encrypting all of the data sent between two computers. </li>
    <li>Provide message integrity between two computers (without encrypting data). </li>
    <li>Provide mutual authentication between two computers. For example, you can help secure a database server by establishing a policy that permits requests only from a specific client computer (for example, an application or Web server). </li>
    <li>Restrict which computers can communicate with one another. You can also restrict communication to specific IP protocols and TCP/UDP ports.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&amp;nbsp;Using IPSec is not a a possibility when the two servers are not using static ip addresses.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To secure traffic between two servers, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Create an IP Filter.</strong> This&amp;nbsp;restricts&amp;nbsp;what computers can communicate with each other, and require that&amp;nbsp;specific&amp;nbsp;communication protocols are used.&amp;nbsp;A filter consists of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A source IP address or range of addresses. </li>
        <li>A destination IP address or range of addresses. </li>
        <li>An IP protocol, such as TCP, UDP, or "any." </li>
        <li>Source and destination ports (for TCP or UDP only).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Create Filter Actions.</strong> This procedure creates two filter actions. The first will be used to block all communications from specified computers and the second will be used to enforce the use of encryption between application server and database server computers. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Create Rules.</strong> This procedure creates two new rules that will be used to associate the filter that you created in Procedure 1, with the two filter actions you created in Procedure 2. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Export the IPSec Policy to the Remote Computer.</strong> The IPSec policy that you have created on the database server must now be exported and copied to the application server computer. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Assign Policies.</strong> An IPSec policy must be assigned before it becomes active. Note that only one policy may be active at any one time on a particular computer. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that it Works.</strong> Use Network Monitor (netmon.exe) to verify that data sent between the two servers&amp;nbsp;is encrypted. </p>
    </li>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Applications should assume that all of their input is malicious, and take action accordingly.&amp;nbsp; Input should&amp;nbsp;be validated and either rejected or sanitized immediately, carefully quarantined during use, and encoded appropriately on output.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Malicious input is the single largest cause of vulnerabilities in web applications, and in the most general sense, is the root cause of almost every issue.&amp;nbsp; The only way to ensure safety is by a defense in depth, default deny policy that starts with the fundamental supposition that all input is malicious until proven otherwise. For example, if you call an external Web service that returns strings, how do you know that malicious commands are not present? Also, if several applications write to a shared database, when you read data, how do you know whether it is safe?</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All applications should assume that all their input is malicious.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Getting input validation correct is tricky; there's a reason that it's the number one security problem for web applications.&amp;nbsp; However, when approached systematically, it's not too hard of a&amp;nbsp;problem to solve.&amp;nbsp; Follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Determine all inputs.&amp;nbsp;</b>The first step is to determine all the things in the application which can be controlled by the user.&amp;nbsp; There are some surprises here -- a lot of the variables in a normal HTTP server environment are actually taken from the user's request, so make sure you know exactly where everything is coming from.&amp;nbsp; It's a good idea to leave a brief comment in the code where the input comes in mentioning where it comes from (if it isn't obvious from context), the expected format, and where it's validated (again, if it isn't obvious).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Determine all trusted data stores.</b>&amp;nbsp;Every application has at least one, usually multiple data stores.&amp;nbsp; It's important to know when a data store can be trusted.&amp;nbsp; The guideline here is simple; if the system in question is the only input into the data store, then you can rely on the semantics enforced by your input validation routines to apply to all data found in the store.&amp;nbsp; If other applications access the data store, then you can't.&amp;nbsp; While it is possible to check the semantics of every validation routine in every other system that accesses the data store, it's simpler and safer to assume that the data store is untrusted, and treat it as a potential source of malicious data, validating all input from it as you would any other input.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Determine all crossover points.&amp;nbsp;</b>Crossover points are one of the places where malicious input becomes a bug.&amp;nbsp; They're not necessarily places where output occurs; in fact, they'll often occur many layers further in than that in large applications.&amp;nbsp; A crossover point is anywhere where user input is included textually in some larger body of command text, or where a security-relevant decision is made based on it.&amp;nbsp; A good example of a crossover point is a dynamic SQL query.&amp;nbsp; The risk here is of the user input crossing over into the associated command data, allowing an attacker to execute commands.&amp;nbsp; Xpath and other XML injections are another example here.&amp;nbsp; The worst case here is when user input is evaluated by a languages built-in "eval" command or something similar -- these commands should never be used, even with values that look safe, because of the risks associated.</p>
      <p>Once the crossover points are found, all inputs should be traced back to make sure that they've been validated appropriately beforehand, and a comment again stating the format, source, and validation point should be made.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All crossover points have, depending on the technology involved, different sets of safe characters.&amp;nbsp; Using the whitelist approach described below, the safe set of characters for that crossover point should be compared against what the validator will allow through; the allowed characters must be a subset of the safe ones.</p>
      <p>Whenever possible, steps should be taken to remove crossover points entirely.&amp;nbsp; Switching from dynamic SQL to stored procedures with bound parameters removes an entire category of crossover points from the system, and greatly reduces risk to an entire class of attacks.&amp;nbsp; Similar things can be done with other types of crossovers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Determine all outputs.&amp;nbsp;</b>The last point of concern is the list of outputs from the system.&amp;nbsp; This will likely have a certain amount of overlap with the list of crossover points, which is fine.&amp;nbsp; Again, we need to determine the allowable format for each output, and look at where the incoming data is being validated.&amp;nbsp; If there's any question of whether the data may contain dangerous characters, it should be encoded in a manner appropriate to the specific output.&amp;nbsp; There are more output contexts than one might think; the contents of HTML attributes, the tags themselves, free text between the tags, and javascript strings all have different safe sets of characters (and a different encoding, in the last case).&amp;nbsp; Comments on the input source, format, validation point, and encoding point&amp;nbsp;are also useful here.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Build a centralized validation module.&amp;nbsp;</b>One of the biggest dangers of implementing input validation is inconsistent validation; an attack may be caught on one data path, but not on another.&amp;nbsp; An attacker will try all of them, however.&amp;nbsp; The way to solve this problem is to have a single point of responsibility for input validation.&amp;nbsp; Where this is depends on the design.&amp;nbsp; If every piece of input is an object, then it may be appropriate to have the object constructs and setters perform the validation for that object's input.&amp;nbsp; In a less strictly OO system, a single module with methods for each different input format may be more appropriate.</p>
      <p>Which ever method is chosen, the input validation routine for a specific data type should be as strict as possible.&amp;nbsp; For example, when validating a US zip code, allow either 5 or 9 numbers, and nothing else.&amp;nbsp; If you're dealing with international postal codes, either validate them seperately with a looser format that also allows letters, or build a more complex validator that understands the postal codes of each nation, if you need to ensure a higher level of integrity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Build a centralized encoding module.&amp;nbsp;</b>In an ideal world, all encoding routines would be done via the same libraries which are used to create output.&amp;nbsp; While many HTML control libraries attempt this, none of them take the whitelist approach.&amp;nbsp; Instead, they try to guess which characters might be harmful, a list which is categorically incomplete.&amp;nbsp; Unless you want to build a new output library (which might be an option on a large enough application), you should build a set of data encoders for each output context which you have.&amp;nbsp; These encoders should be used as close as possible to the actual point of output; this minimizes the chance of an alternate data path skipping the encoding, and ensures that the developer knows exactly what context the output is being used in.&amp;nbsp; Avoid the temptation to store encoded data, because even if it is initially only used in the context you encoded it for, this may change over time.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Ensure that all paths through the system preserve validation.</b>&amp;nbsp;Once the validation system is complete, all the paths that data takes through the system should be checked to ensure that they preserve the validation properties that are expected.&amp;nbsp; Input which is sent round-trip through a client or another system must be re-validated, unless a cryptographic signature is used to ensure that it has not been tampered with.&amp;nbsp; Validation which occurs on an untrusted system must also be repeated. Client-side validation in javascript is a nice UI touch, but it is trivially circumvented as&amp;nbsp; a security measure.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>A suite of web applications on an e-commerce site share a common back-end database.&amp;nbsp; The largest application is&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;order entry system and shopping cart.&amp;nbsp; This was the first application built, and was designed with the assumption that the database was trusted. Later, a lightweight app to allow users to quickly check stock levels was built. Because it was a small "read-only" use of the database, input validation was not built into the application.&amp;nbsp; The application contained a SQL injection, allowing an attacker to alter the database in such a way that they could&amp;nbsp;inject javascript into pages which displayed the shopping cart application, allowing them to steal user's passwords.&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>A suite of web applications on an e-commerce site share a common back-end database.&amp;nbsp; The largest application is&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;order entry system and shopping cart.&amp;nbsp; This was the first application built, and was designed with the assumption that the database was trusted.&amp;nbsp; Later, a lightweight app to allow users to quickly check stock levels was built.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When the new application was added, the developers realized that the database could no longer be treated as a trusted data store, and added code to the main application to perform data validation on input from the database.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Because the new application was a small "read-only" use of the database, the input validation routines written were not properly checked.&amp;nbsp; When an attacker found a SQL injection via the new application and altered the back-end database, they were unable to make that attack chain through to the main application.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, the logging performed by the main application's data validation routines altered the operations group to the problem, allowing them to fix the smaller application.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Protect all sensitive data that is stored within configuration files.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Configuration files are a likely target for any attacker. If an attacker does compromise the configuration files, any unprotected sensitive data inside them will also be compromised.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application uses configuration files that contain sensitive data such as connection strings, directory paths or credentials, then protect the files.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To protect sensitive data inside configuration files use the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the sensitive data. </strong>Locate all sensitive data that is stored inside configuration files. Examples of sensitive data include, but are not limited to, credentials, connection strings and directory paths.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Encrypt sensitive data inside the configuration files. </strong>Encrypt the sensitive data inside the configuration file to ensure its confidentiality in case this file is compromised. Once the application accesses the configuration file, it should decrypt the sensitive data just before use. Example:</p>
      <pre>public Properties loadDatabaseCredentials()<br />      throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException{<br />      // Set the decryption mechanism<br />      byte[] rawKey = getEncryptionKey();<br />      SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(rawKey, "AES");<br />      Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");<br />      cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, skeySpec);<br /><br />      // Decrypt config file<br /><br />      File configFile = new File("../../config/testProp.config");<br />      byte[] tempBuff = new byte[(int)configFile.length()];<br />      FileInputStream fileStream = new FileInputStream(configFile);<br />      fileStream.read(tempBuff, 0, tempBuff.length);<br /><br />      InputStream propStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(cipher.doFinal(tempBuff));<br />      prop.load(propStream);<br />      propStream.close();<br />      fileStream.close();<br /><br />      return prop;}</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Protect configuration files.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Choose a configuration directory</strong>: Dedicate a directory for storing your application's configuration files. Make sure the directory is not web-accessible. This limits the scope of users&amp;nbsp;who can potentially compromise the contents inside the directory.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Set appropriate permissions</strong>: Apply the appropriate filesystem permissions such that the configuration files can be only accessed by your application and its administrators.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code retrieves database credentials from a configuration file. Unfortunately, the credentials are not encrypted; therefore, anybody with access to the configuration file can retrieve the credentials and access the database on behalf of the application.</p>
  <pre>public Properties loadDatabaseCredentials() throws IOException{<br />      Properties prop = new Properties();<br />      InputStream propStream = new FileInputStream("../../config/testProp.config");<br />      prop.load(propStream);<br />      propStream.close();<br /><br />      return prop;}</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code retrieves database credentials from a configuration file. Because the credentials are encrypted, the application decrypts them in real time, protecting the credentials' confidentiality in case the local access to the configuration file is not properly secured.</p>
  <pre>public Properties loadDatabaseCredentials()<br />      throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException{<br />      // Set the decryption mechanism<br />      byte[] rawKey = getEncryptionKey();<br />      SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(rawKey, "AES");<br />      Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");<br />      cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, skeySpec);<br /><br />      // Decrypt config file<br /><br />      File configFile = new File("../../config/testProp.config");<br />      byte[] tempBuff = new byte[(int)configFile.length()];<br />      FileInputStream fileStream = new FileInputStream(configFile);<br />      fileStream.read(tempBuff, 0, tempBuff.length);<br /><br />      InputStream propStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(cipher.doFinal(tempBuff));<br />      prop.load(propStream);<br />      propStream.close();<br />      fileStream.close();<br /><br />      return prop;}</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Calculate destinations of redirects and forwards without user input.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using input to calculate destinations of redirects or forwards may allow an attacker to create hyperlinks that appears to point to legitimate sites but redirect to malicious pages controlled by the attacker. This technique is often used by phishers to trick people into visiting fake sites that steal authentication credentials.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Use this guideline when writing a web application that uses redirects or forwards. Avoid using redirects or forwards in web applications, if possible.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to calculate destinations of redirects and forwards without user input:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Find redirects and forwards.</strong> Find all pages that perform redirects or forwards. Redirects are also known as "transfers" in .NET.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify dangerous redirects and forwards.</strong> Find all redirects and forwards that rely on user input to calculate their destinations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Rewrite redirects and forwards.</strong> Consider making design or code changes to get rid of each redirect or forward, if possible. If a redirect or forward is absolutely necessary, consider how it may be rewritten to operate without user input - this is usually possible based on assumptions made in the application design.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use the RSA Protected Configuration provider to encrypt sections of your configuration files. You can use Aspnet_regiis.exe tool to encrypt sensitive data, such as connection strings, held in the Web.config and Machine.config files.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Connection strings contain sensitive resource access credentials (e.g., a connection string for a SQL server resource includes a username and password.) Connection strings stored in plaintext are dangerous, because an attacker that can compromise a server will be able to read those connection strings. Even if a machine is not compromised, connection strings stored in plain text&amp;nbsp;are accessible to administrators and any other users with sufficient privileges&amp;nbsp;on the host machine and/or Windows domain.&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Always encrypt connection strings. In&amp;nbsp;a web farm environment,&amp;nbsp;the RSA protected configuration provider is an effective way to encrypt and decrypt configuration file sections&amp;nbsp;because it uses asymmetric encryption to encrypt and decrypt,&amp;nbsp;meaning&amp;nbsp;the keys can easily be exported and imported&amp;nbsp;from server to server.&amp;nbsp;If the application is not deployed to a web farm environment DPAPI will work as well as RSA for encrypting connection strings.&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to encrypt sections of your configuration files: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the configuration sections to be encrypted.</strong> Encrypting and decrypting data incurs performance overhead. To keep this overhead to a minimum, encrypt only the sections of your configuration file that store sensitive data. In this case, we are interested in encrypting the &lt;connectionStrings&gt; element of the Web.config file since that is where the database connection string will reside. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose the machine or user store.</strong> The DataProtectionConfigurationProvider supports machine-level and user-level stores for key storage. The choice of store depends largely on whether or not your application shares a server with other applications and whether or not sensitive data must be kept private for each application. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Encrypt your configuration file data.</strong> Use the RSA Provider to Encrypt a Connection String in Web.config in a Web Farm. To do this, you must create a custom RSA encryption key container and deploy the same key container on all servers in your Web farm. This won't work by default because the default RSA encryption key, "NetFrameworkConfigurationKey", is different for each computer.</p>
      <p>Run&amp;nbsp;the following command from a .NET command prompt to encrypt the connectionStrings section using the machine level store:</p>
      <pre>aspnet_regiis -pe "connectionStrings" -app "/MachineRSA"</pre>
      <p>Note: If your ASP.NET application identity does not have access to the .NET Framework configuration key store, you'll need to grant access.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use encryption to protect sensitive data that is transmitted over the network. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Because network traffic&amp;nbsp;is easily eavesdropped on or modified by attackers, passing sensitive data as plaintext&amp;nbsp;over the network&amp;nbsp;can lead&amp;nbsp;to a host of attacks, including data theft and data manipulation.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Apply this guideline when your application transmits sensitive data over unprotected communication channels.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to protect sensitive data over the network:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive information. </strong>Sensitive data is any information that is kept secret and should be disclosed only to authorized parties. Common examples of sensitive data include, but are not limited to, names of customers, government issued ID numbers, credit card and other financial information, passwords and private keys. Some industries, such as health care and banking, have regulatory standards that define sensitive information. Use regulatory requirements, as they apply to your application, to identify sensitive data. Sensitive data can be defined as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information that either contains personally identifiable information or can be used to derive personally identifiable information that should not be shared with others. </li>
        <li>Information that a user provides that they would not want shared with other users of the application. </li>
        <li>Information that comes from an external trusted source that is not designed to be shared with users.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose an appropriate protection mechanism. </strong>Choosing the appropriate protection mechanism may depend on various conditions: purpose of the sensitive data, role of the other network party, infrastructure and supported technologies. Because sensitive data must be encrypted when in transit, there are two strategies, to encrypt the communication channel or to encrypt the application data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Encrypt the communication channel</strong>: Depending on the current infrastructure and the other network party, it is possible to encrypt the connections using Java's crypto library or any technologies supported by the remote party.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Encrypt the application data</strong>: If your application's communication channels cannot be encrypted, encrypt the application data. Hashing or encryption should be used when protecting the application data. Use hashing if the application data will be used only for comparison purposes. Use encryption if the application data will be retrieved at a later stage.</p>
          <p>If hashing is used, choose a longer salt, 16 or more bits.&amp;nbsp;In the case&amp;nbsp;that the produced hash is compromised, longer salts make it more difficult for an attacker to gain access to the sensitive data. If your application uses randomly generated salt, make sure that your application encrypts the random salt and stores it in a configuration file. Always use <strong>SecureRandom</strong> and not <strong>Random</strong> to generate the salt. Example of using <strong>SecureRandom</strong> to generate a random salt:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <pre>public static byte[] generateSalt() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException<br />{<br />      // Note that salt is declared as private static byte[] and is<br />      // initialized to null.<br />      if (salt == null)<br />      {<br />            SecureRandom srand = SecureRandom.getInstance("SHA1PRNG");<br />                          salt = new byte[4];<br />            srand.nextBytes(salt);<br />      }<br />       return salt;<br />}</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Choosing a strong hashing algorithm is also important. Stronger algorithms prevent multiple unique pieces of data from producing identical hash values. The current recommendation is to use SHA-256 or stronger.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <pre>public String hashCredentials(char[] pass, byte[] salt)<br />      throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException<br />{<br />      MessageDigest md;<br />      byte[] tempPass;<br />      byte[] digest;<br />            md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-512");<br />      //Convert char[] to byte[]<br />      tempPass = new byte[pass.length];<br />      for (int i = 0; i &lt; pass.length; i++)<br />      {<br />            tempPass[i] = (byte)pass[i];<br />      }<br />      md.update(tempPass);<br />      md.update(salt);<br />      digest = md.digest();<br />      md.reset();<br />      //Clean tempPass<br />      for (int i = 0; i &lt; tempPass.length; i++)<br />      {<br />            tempPass[i] = 0;<br />      }<br />       return new String(digest);<br />}</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Use encryption if the application data will be retrieved at a later stage.<br /><br />Use symmetric encryption if and only if your application is the only entity that will access the encrypted data. Use a key size of 265-bit or higher and AES for symmetric encryption.<br /><br />Use public/private key encryption if the data will be accessed by two or more parties. Use a key size of 2048-bit or higher and RSA for public/private key encryption. Public/private key encryption allows your application to share sensitive data with multiple entities without disclosing its own encryption key.</p>
          <pre>// Because the following code generates a new encryption key,<br />// make sure to store it into the application's keystore.<br />KeyGenerator kgen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");<br />kgen.init(256);<br />SecretKey skey = kgen.generateKey();<br />// Set up cipherCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");<br />cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, skey);<br />// Note that sensitiveData is of type byte[] and contains<br />// data that is sensitive in naturebyte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(sensitiveData);</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Apply the appropriate protection mechanism</strong>. Evaluate the code and determine the places where sensitive data is transmitted. Apply the established protection mechanism at each location.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>try<br />{<br />      // The application produces a hash based on the sensitive data<br />      userEmail = MyApp.getEmailForUser(user);<br />      passDigest = encryptCredentials(userEmail, pass, salt);<br />}<br />catch (GeneralSecurityException gse)<br />{<br />      // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms<br />      return false;}catch (IOException ioe)<br />{<br />      // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms<br />      return false;<br />}<br />// The application stores the hashed sensitive data into the database<br />Connection cn = MyApp.getDBConnection();<br />PreparedStatement st = cn.prepareStatement("select login_attempts from myappUsers"<br />                                        + " where user = ? and pass = ?;");<br />st.setString(1, user);<br />st.setBytes(2, passDigest);<br />ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery();</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> PCI DSS requirements state that all sensitive data must be encrypted before being sent over the network or be sent over an encrypted channel.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code authenticates a user based on a username and password. The supplied credentials are compared to the credentials stored in the backend database. Unfortunately, the credentials are transmitted in plaintext and could be stolen if the network is compromised.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />      // Query the credential store with the provided credentials<br />      ...<br />}</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code validates the user based on&amp;nbsp;a given username and password. It uses the user's valid email address and a random salt to encrypt the user's password before comparing&amp;nbsp;the username and the produced digest against the data stored in the backend database. Therefore, the password is encrypted before being transmitted over the network and is protected from being compromised.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>public boolean validateUser(String user, char[] pass)<br />{<br />       ...<br />       // Encrypt the credentials<br />      try<br />      {<br />            userEmail = MyApp.getEmailForUser(user);<br />            passDigest = encryptCredentials(userEmail, pass, salt);<br />      }<br />      catch (GeneralSecurityException gse)<br />      {<br />            // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms<br />            return false;<br />      }<br />     catch (IOException ioe)<br />      {<br />            // Add the appropriate logging and exception handling mechanisms<br />            return false;<br />      }<br />       // Query the credential store and execute the rest of the authentication steps<br />      ...<br />}<br />public static byte[] encryptCredentials(String email, char[] pass, byte[] salt)<br />      throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException<br />{<br />      MessageDigest md; <br />      byte[] tempPass;<br />      byte[] rawKey;<br />      // Generate encryption key<br />      md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-512");<br />      md.update(email.getBytes("UTF-8"));<br />      md.update(salt);<br />      rawKey = md.digest();<br />      md.reset();<br />      SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(rawKey, "AES");<br />      // Set up cipher<br />      Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");<br />      cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, skeySpec);<br />      // Convert char[] to byte[]<br />      tempPass = new byte[pass.length];<br />      for (int i = 0; i &lt; pass.length; i++)<br />      {<br />            tempPass[i] = (byte)pass[i];<br />      }<br />      // Encrypt password<br />      byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(tempPass);<br />            //Clean tempPass<br />      for (int i = 0; i &lt; tempPass.length; i++)<br />      {<br />            tempPass[i] = 0;<br />      }<br />      return encrypted;<br />}</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Examine what algorithms your application uses and for what purpose and ensure that correct algorithm and correct key sizes are being used.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Cryptography only provides real security if it is used appropriately and the right algorithms are used for the right job. The strength of the algorithm is also important.&amp;nbsp; Larger key sizes result in improved security, but performance suffers. Stronger encryption is most important for persisted data that is retained in data stores for prolonged periods of time.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application uses cryptography to provide security, examine what algorithm and key size it uses and the way it is used.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>It is important to make sure you choose the right algorithm for the right job and to make sure you use a key size that provides a sufficient degree of security. Larger key sizes generally increase security. The following list summarizes the major algorithms together with the key sizes that each uses: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data Encryption Standard (DES) 64-bit key (8 bytes) </li>
    <li>TripleDES 128-bit key or 192-bit key (16 or 24 bytes) </li>
    <li>Rijndael 128-256 bit keys (16-32 bytes) </li>
    <li>RSA 384-16,384 bit keys (48-2,048 bytes) </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For large data encryption, use the TripleDES symmetric encryption algorithm (also&amp;nbsp;called Triple Data Encryption Algorithm, TDEA) . For slower and stronger encryption of large data, use Rijndael,&amp;nbsp;also known as Advanced Encryption Standard(AES). As per NIST&amp;nbsp;recomendations, 192-256-bit AES&amp;nbsp;keys are required for highly sensitive data.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To encrypt data that is to be stored for short periods of time, you can consider using a faster but weaker algorithm such as DES. For digital signatures, use Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) or Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). NIST guidelines suggest that 15360-bit RSA keys are equivalent&amp;nbsp;to 256-bit symmetric keys in strength. For hashing, use the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)1.0. For keyed hashes, use the Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) SHA1.0.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>To avoid the performance overhead of using SSL across your entire site, consider using a separate folder to help protect pages that require authenticated access. Configure that folder in IIS to require SSL access. Those pages that support anonymous access can safely be accessed over HTTP connections.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using SSL across an entire site can incur a significant performance penalty. For sites that have pages which may be viewed without encryption or authentication, it will improve performance to separate out restricted from non-restricted pages. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>This technique should be employed whenever an application has a mix of pages - some of which require authentication while others don't. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To avoid having to use SSL across your entire site, structure your Web site so that the secure pages that require authenticated access are placed in a subdirectory that is separate from the anonymously accessible pages.&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <p>
    <strong>To secure pages in a separate subfolder</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>In Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), configure the secure folder to require SSL. This sets the <strong>AccessSSL=true</strong> attribute for the folder in the IIS Metabase. Requests for pages in the secured folders are successful only if HTTPS is used for the request URL. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Use an &lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; element to ensure that only authenticated users can access secure pages. Place this element beneath the closing &lt;<strong>/system.web</strong>&gt; tag, as shown here. </p>
      <pre>&lt;!-- The secure folder is for authenticated and SSL access only. --&gt;<br />&lt;location path="Secure" &gt;<br />  &lt;system.web&gt;<br />    &lt;authorization&gt;<br />      &lt;deny users="?" /&gt;<br />    &lt;/authorization&gt;<br />  &lt;/system.web&gt;<br />&lt;/location&gt;  </pre>
      <p>Additionally, the following configuration ensures that unauthenticated users are allowed to access pages in the application's root directory. Place this configuration in the main &lt;<strong>system.web</strong>&gt; element. </p>
      <pre>&lt;system.web&gt;<br />  &lt;!-- The virtual directory root folder contains general pages.<br />       Unauthenticated users can view them and they do not need<br />        to be secured with SSL. --&gt;<br />  &lt;authorization&gt;<br />    &lt;allow users="*" /&gt;<br />  &lt;/authorization&gt;<br />&lt;/system.web&gt;  </pre>
      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you use this type of site structure, your application must not rely on the user's identity on the non-SSL pages. In the preceding configuration, a no forms authentication ticket is sent for requests for non-SSL pages. As a result, the user is considered anonymous. This has implications for related features, such as personalization, that require the user name.<strong>&amp;nbsp;</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Treat input from all external sources as untrusted and apply input validation techniques.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Input that is not validated can lead to cross-site scripting, SQL injection, directory traversals, and other vulnerabilities&amp;nbsp;that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Treat all input as untrusted. If you have established trust boundaries for your application, then validate data every time it crosses a trust boundary.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>An application can take input via various ways: web interface, database, file system, other software running on the server, etc. Use the following steps to establish a validation strategy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Establish your application's trust boundary:</strong> The notion is that all input not generated by your application is untrusted.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all sources of input</strong>: An application can have various sources of input and each one is an entry point to your application&amp;nbsp;that can potentially be used to break your application's security model. Enumerate all possible sources of input and make note of the expected input&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;each source. Potential sources of input in a web application typically include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>URL based parameters </li>
        <li>Form based parameters </li>
        <li>Hidden fields </li>
        <li>Cookies </li>
        <li>HTTP headers </li>
        <li>Local filesystem </li>
        <li>Database </li>
        <li>Other related services</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Understand the input that your application can handle and process</strong>: After identifying the different entry points, define the format and type of input that&amp;nbsp;should be provided through each entry point. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Create a set of validators</strong>: Build a validator for each format and type of expected input. Centralize your application's validators as it helps strengthen the code by limiting the amount of scattered validation code throughout your application. Place the set of validators on your application's trust boundary. Your application should accept input from the outside world only through its set of validators.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code produces a data analysis based on a financial index. Unfortunately, the application validates the user's input but not the returned data from the database. Therefore, the application is vulnerable to an integer overflow that can harm the business logic used in generating the data analysis.</p>

  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code produces a data analysis based on a financial index. Since the code validates all sources of input to the application, the application is secured against SQL injection and integer overflows.&amp;nbsp;</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Client-side validation can reduce the number of round trips to the server, but do not rely on it for security because it is easy to bypass. Validate all input at the server. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>It is easy to modify the behavior of the client or just write a new client that does not observe the same data validation rules.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All applications should only use Server-side validation when the code relys on security.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Server-side code should perform its own validation. What if an attacker bypasses your client, or shuts off your client-side script routines, for example, by disabling JavaScript? Use client-side validation to help reduce the number of round trips to the server but do not rely on it for security. This is an example of defense in depth.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Encrypt configuration sections containing sensitive data such as passwords or usernames. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Configuration sections typically contain privacy sensitive resource access credentials (e.g., a connection string for a SQL server resource includes a username and password.) As a precautionary measure, they should not be stored in plaintext, because an attacker that can compromise a server will be able to read those values if they are not adequately protected. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>This guideline is applicable whenever configuration sections are utilized. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>In ASP.NET, you can use either the DPAPI or RSA protected configuration providers to encrypt specific sections that contain sensitive data. The sections that usually contain sensitive information that you need to encrypt include <i>&lt;appSettings&gt;, &lt;connectionStrings&gt;, &lt;identity&gt;,</i> and <i>&lt;sessionState&gt;</i>. To encrypt the <i>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;</i> section by using the DPAPI provider with the machine-key store (the default configuration), run the following command from a command window:</p>
  <div>
    <br />
    <pre>aspnet_regiis -pe "connectionStrings" -app "/MachineDPAPI" -prov "DataProtectionConfigurationProvider" </pre>
    <br />
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>-pe</strong>: Specifies the configuration section to encrypt. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>-app</strong>: Specifies your Web application's virtual path. If your application is nested, you need to specify the nested path from the root directory; for example, "/test/aspnet/MachineDPAPI". </li>
    <li>
      <strong>-prov</strong>: Specifies the provider name.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you need to encrypt configuration file data on multiple servers in a Web farm, you should use RSA protected configuration provider because of the ease with which you can export RSA key containers.&amp;nbsp;</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Do not trust input. Instead, validate on the server that it matches the expected input, be careful which contexts you allow it to be used in, and encode it appropriately on output.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>An attacker passing malicious input can attempt SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other injection attacks that aim to exploit your application's vulnerabilities. Validating input helps to reduce these risks by ensuring that the input received matches the expected format. Input validation on its own is not sufficient; output encoding is also needed to fully prevent these attacks, but it is an important step for both security and reliability.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All input should always be validated, regardless of source. Unless data is actually static within the scope of the local code base, it could be modified by a malicious user—even data in a database which is supposed to be static.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to validate input from all sources:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify data to validate.</strong> Input must be validated on the server for security checks.&amp;nbsp; While it can be useful for user experience reasons to check the input on the client side, especially on things like web applications with high round-trip latencies, this client-side validation is not sufficient to provide security guarantees, as it can be circumvented by the attacker. Check for known good data and constrain input by validating it for type, length, format, and range. For Web form applications that obtain input through server controls, use the ASP.NET validator controls, such as the RegularExpressionValidator, RangeValidator, and CustomValidator, to validate and constrain input. All input not under control of the system should be validated, but input coming directly from users must be validated and should receive the most attention. Most Web applications accept input from various sources, including HTML controls, server controls, query strings, and cookies. Validate input from all of these sources to help prevent injection attacks. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use regular expressions.</strong> Use regular expressions to help validate input. In general, validate your input against the least permissive expression possible that will accept all the input you expect for that field. If you know that the field will have certain internal structure, check for it. If there is a range of standard formats which your users may enter data in, but these formats are easily converted to a single internal format, do so.&amp;nbsp;The following example shows how to use the Regex class. </p>
      <pre>using System.Text.RegularExpressions;<br />// Instance method:<br />Regex reg = new Regex(@"^[a-zA-Z'.\s]{1,40}$");<br />Response.Write(reg.IsMatch(Request.QueryString["Name"]));<br />// Static method:<br />if (!Regex.IsMatch(Request.QueryString["Name"],@"^[a-zA-Z'.\s]{1,40}$"))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Name does not match expression<br />}</pre>
      <p>If you cannot cache your regular expression for frequent use, you should use the static IsMatch method where possible for performance reasons, to avoid unnecessary object creation. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Validate numeric data.</strong> Check all numeric fields for type and range. If you are not using server controls, you can use regular expressions and the Regex class, and you can validate numeric ranges by converting the input value to an integer or double, ensuring the conversion was valid, and then performing a range check. If your input has an internal checksum, like a credit card number, check that too.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Validate address data.</strong> Address data has a fairly rich internal structure; the more of this structure your validation routine understands, the better you'll be able to validate the information. Phone numbers can be validated as a string of ten digits, or a variable number of digits beginning with the character '+' if international numbers are allowed. If needed, the country code can be determined and the exact number format looked up. While phone numbers are written several different ways, a canonical representation can be created by stripping all non-numeric characters before validation, something which will save your users time and frustration as they enter data into your site. Street addresses require a little bit more care; if the input is taken in divided into street, city, etc., each field can have a seperate safe character set defined--city names don't need numbers, for instance. Names are fairly straightforward, but are one of the cases where the "'" character is valid input, and thus they must be handled appropriately (as all input should be) at the database level. Also, don't forget to allow accented characters in names and addresses, depending on your current code page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Validate reference data.</strong> Data that refers to other things can go through one final step of validation, namely looking up what it refers to insure that the reference is valid. For instance, postal codes can be validated against a canonical list to ensure correctness, and other aspects of the street address cross-checked with that. In an order management system, item IDs can be checked against a list of valid IDs.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Validating input does not remove the need to format output, parametrize queries, or otherwise handle user input carefully.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An order form for a web store has several fields, specifically, a name, address, phone number, item number, and quantity. Each item is simply added to the database with no data validation and all typecasting handled by the database. Typecasting in the database does not prevent SQL injection and has little effect on out of range data. An attacker can perform numerous attacks, from something as benign as filling the database with garbage data to more actively destructive SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>An ASP.NET application contains an order for for a web store. Each of the forms fields are validated, giving stronger guarantees about the data gathered. The phone number is validated as a string of ten digits (after stripping all non-numeric characters), or a variable number of digits beginning with the character '+' if international numbers are allowed. </p>
  <p>Validating a name, address, and item number can all be a bit more complicated. The first order of business is determining the legal character set for each case. For names, spaces, upper and lower case letters (including the accented forms for your current codepage), and possible numbers and periods are enough. Addresses need to add commas, hyphens, and number signs, at a minimum. Validating item numbers may be as simple as casting to an integer and checking that the result is in the right range, or it may mean a more complicated regular expression that checks for internal formatting in a string. </p>
  <p>The last, optional step of data validation is to ensure that the data refers to a valid things. The data should be validated for format first, especially as further checks may require database queries. Item numbers are an obvious thing to check for existence in the DB, and this would normally happen as part of the stored procedure which creates a new order, but names, addresses, and phone numbers can be similarly checked, some times. For example, if the address field is broken up into components, state or province information, zip/post codes, and city names, at a minimum, can all be validated against existing lists.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Ensure that the code enforce password complexity rules and restricts the number of failed logon attempts. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Restricting the number of failed login attempts helps to counter the threat of dictionary attacks. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>The use of strong passwords, restricted login attempts, and other best practice account management policies can be enforced by Windows security policy if your application uses Windows authentication. Otherwise, the application layer is responsible for this. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <h2>Use Account Lockout Policies for End-User Accounts</h2>
  <p>Disable end-user accounts or write events to a log after a set number of failed logon attempts. If you are using Windows authentication, such as NTLM or the Kerberos protocol, these policies can be configured and applied automatically by the operating system. With Forms authentication, these policies are the responsibility of the application and must be incorporated into the application design.</p>
  <p>Be careful that account lockout policies cannot be abused in denial of service attacks. For example, well known default service accounts such as IUSR_MACHINENAME should be replaced by custom account names to prevent an attacker who obtains the Internet Information Services (IIS) Web server name from locking out this critical account.</p>
  <h2>Be Able to Disable Accounts</h2>
  <p>If the system is compromised, being able to deliberately invalidate credentials or disable accounts can prevent additional attacks.</p>
  <p>The use of strong passwords, restricted login attempts, and other best practice account management policies can be enforced by Windows security policy if your application uses Windows authentication. Otherwise, the application layer is responsible for this. Review the following aspects of the account management of your application: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Does your application enforce strong passwords?</strong>
      <p>For example, do your ASP.NET Web pages use regular expressions to verify password complexity rules?&amp;nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Do you restrict the number of failed login attempts?</strong>
      <p>Doing so can help counter the threat of dictionary attacks. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Do you reveal too much information in the event of failure?</strong>
      <p>Make sure you do not display messages such as "Incorrect password" because this tells malicious users that the user name is correct. This allows them to focus their efforts on cracking passwords. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Do you enforce a periodic change of passwords?</strong>
      <p>This is recommended because otherwise there is a high probability that a user will not change his or her password, which makes it more vulnerable. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Can you quickly disable accounts in the event of compromise?</strong>
      <p>If an account is compromised, can you easily disable the account to prevent the attacker from continuing to use the account? </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Does your application record login attempts?</strong>
      <p>Recording failed login attempts is an effective way to detect an attacker who is attempting to break in. </p>
    </li>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use SSL as an encrypted communication channel to protect data sent between servers and web browsers. SSL can be used to help protect communication by encrypting traffic such as account information, billing data, etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>If sensitive data is sent between client and server unprotected it may be stolen or modified.&amp;nbsp; SSL can be used to help protect communication between client and server by encrypting network traffic.&amp;nbsp; Encryption will protect against eavesdropping (theft) but an attacker may still blindly modify the data for malicious purposes.&amp;nbsp; Use integrity checking (HMAC) to ensure the data has not been modified.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Use&amp;nbsp;SSL for communication between web browser and web server, when page content&amp;nbsp;needs to be encrypted on the network and the&amp;nbsp;identity&amp;nbsp;of the server needs to be guaranteed. </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: SSL does carry a significant performance penalty in terms of latency that is introduced due to encryption/decryption of pages, so it is important to optimize the number of pages that use SSL. Please see "Guideline: Performance:Use SSL Only for Pages That Require It" for more information.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use SSL to create a secure encrypted communication channel between browser clients and Web server.</p>
  <p>To use SSL:</p>
  <p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1. Install a server certificate on the Web server.<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2. Install the root certificate authority (CA) certificate from the same authority into the local computer's Trusted Root Certification Authorities certificate store.<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3. Use IIS to configure the server to force the use of encryption while accessing Web pages.<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4. Design pages with SSL in mind to minimize performance overhead. Optimize pages that use SSL by including less text and simple graphics and partition&amp;nbsp;the site and ensure that only those pages than contain sensitive data use SSL.&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An ASP.NET application allows users to login and maintain their contacts in an online database that is accesible via a web browser. The login&amp;nbsp;credentials are sent in plain text, which allows someone on the network to modify&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;data sent between&amp;nbsp;a browser and a server or view the contents. The lack of integrity and privacy means that the identity of the user and the identity of the web&amp;nbsp;entity serving out the pages can not be verified.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>An ASP.NET application allows users to login and maintain their contacts in an online database that is accesible via a web browser. When the application is deployed, an SSL certificate is installed on the Web Server. The server is then setup to force users to use encryption while visiting pages containing sensitive information.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to protect the authentication credentials passed between browser and server.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using SSL prevents the credentials from being sniffed or tampered with as they are transmitted over the network. If SSL is not used, user credentials may be compromised by attacks such as a Network Credential Sniffing Attack or a Phishing Attack. Additionally, use the Protect Session Cookies guideline to minimize the risk of exposing your application's session cookies to an attacker.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application accepts form-based authentication credentials from users.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) over HTTP requires the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Create a certificate request.</strong> Using the IIS management console, generate an SSL certificate request. This request is then sent to a Certification Authority to be signed.&amp;nbsp;</p>
      <ol>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Present the request to a Certification Authority (CA).</strong> If all conditions for obtaining an SSL certificate are met, the CA will produce a new SSL certificate based on the certificate request. Because the requirements for obtaining an SSL certificate depend on the Certification Authority, consult with the Certification Authority in regards to the administrative steps necessary for obtaining such certificate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Install the certificate.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>
      <ol>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ensure credentials are sent over SSL. </strong>Place the authentication portion of your application on a dedicated subdomain. Configure the server to accept only HTTPS traffic for the authentication subdomain. Ensure that form posts containing credentials are sent over HTTPS.&amp;nbsp;</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following snippet is part of an application's web.config. The application uses form based authentication and has configured its &lt;forms&gt; element accordingly. Unfortunately, the &lt;forms&gt; element does not have the requireSSL attribute set to true. Therefore the application fails to enforce the use of SSL when performing form-based authentication.</p>
  <pre>&lt;!-- The forms element does not have a requireSSL attribute --&gt;<br />&lt;forms loginUrl="Secure/Login.aspx"<br />       protection="All"<br />       timeout="00:30:00" <br />       slidingExpiration="true"<br />       name="MyApp"<br />       path="/Secure"<br /> /&gt;</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Do not echo input back to the user without first validating and/or encoding the data.&amp;nbsp; Data which can be modified by a user must be treated as untrusted data, regardless of whether or not the user is expected to modify it during normal application use. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Echoing input directly back to the user makes your application susceptible to malicious input attacks, such as cross-site scripting.&amp;nbsp; If a malicious user can trick someone else into submitting dangerous input in such a way that it will be returned to the victim, or cause the site to store the malicious input they give it so it will be returned to other users, they can exploit vulnerabilities of this class.&amp;nbsp; What constitutes bad input varies widely depending on the system in question.&amp;nbsp; On the web, it normally means some kind of javascript. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Applications should never echo untrusted or user modifiable data back to the user without appropriate encoding. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If you write output that includes user input or data from a shared database or a local file that you do not trust, encode it.&amp;nbsp; Echoing input directly back to the user makes your application vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks, among other problems.&amp;nbsp; Encoding the data ensures that it is treated as literal text and not as script.&amp;nbsp; ASP.NET's Server.HtmlEncode function is often used to protect against cross-site scripting attacks. However, this function only encodes &lt;&gt;"&amp; characters. This is not sufficient to protect against all possible attacks. For instance, the following ASP.NET code would be vulnerable. </p>
  <pre>&lt;img id='img&lt;%=Server.HtmlEncode(Request.QueryString["userId"]) %&gt;'&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; src='/image.gif' /&gt;</pre>
  <p>An attacker could inject client-side script here by setting <strong>userId </strong>to </p>

  <p>The safest solution is to encode all non-alphanumeric characters. Only this type of whitelist solution will catch all possible XSS attacks, regardless of context.&amp;nbsp; This&amp;nbsp;requires more overhead in terms of processing time and size of the resulting HTML, but it is the safest encoding mechanism for all HTML contexts:</p>
  <pre>public static string HtmlEncode(string x)<br />{<br />   if (x == null)<br />   {<br />   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;return x;<br />   }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;return Regex.Replace(x, "[^a-zA-Z0-9]+", new MatchEvaluator(WebUtility.EncodeMatch));<br />}</pre>
  <p>This is also the approach that the Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library&amp;nbsp;takes.&amp;nbsp; If you are using the Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library, you can use the <strong>Microsoft.Security.ApplicationAntiXSSLibrary.HtmlEncode</strong> method.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, if you write URLs that might contain unsafe characters because they have been constructed from input data or data from a shared database, use <strong>Microsoft.Security.ApplicationAntiXSSLibrary.UrlEncode</strong> to make them safe.&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong> &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Make sure that you encode data at the last possible opportunity before the data is returned to the client.&amp;nbsp; If you encode any earlier than this, you may not know the exact context that the data will be used in, and hence the format you need to encode into.&amp;nbsp; Also, early encoding of some data can result in double encoding problems. </p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Treat input from all external sources as untrusted and apply input validation techniques.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Input that is not validated can lead to cross-site scripting, SQL injection, directory traversals, and other vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or otherwise compromise an application.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Treat all input as untrusted. If you have established trust boundaries for your application, validate data every time it crosses a trust boundary.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>An application can take input via various ways: file system, other software running on the server, etc. Use the following steps to establish a validation strategy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all sources of input:</strong> Establish your application's trust boundary. The general notion is that all input not generated by your application is untrusted. Enumerate all possible sources of input and make note of the expected input from these sources. An application can have various sources of input. Each of these sources is an entry point to your application and can potentially be used to break your application's security model. Place a content specific validator at each entry point.</p>
      <p>Potential sources of input in a web application typically include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>URL based parameters </li>
        <li>Form based parameters </li>
        <li>Hidden fields </li>
        <li>Cookies </li>
        <li>HTTP headers </li>
        <li>Data stored on the local file system </li>
        <li>Database </li>
        <li>Other related services</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Understand the input that your application can handle and process:</strong> Understand the specifics about your application's input. After identifying the different entry points, define the format and type of input that will be provided through each entry point. Build a validator for every format and type of expected input.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Create a set of validators:</strong> Centralize your application's validators as it helps strengthen the code by limiting the amount of scattered validation code throughout your application. Place the set of validators on your application's trust boundary. Your application should accept input from the outside world only through its set of validators.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>In the following code, a page accepts a query string parameter called <strong>isbn</strong>. The value of this variable is used to look up a book in the database using an unmanaged middle-layer.</p>
  <pre>&lt;script language="C#" runat="server"&gt;<br />    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />    {<br />        String strIsbn = this.Request.QueryString["isbn"];<br />        //lookup isbn in a database using an<br />        //unamanged middle layer<br />    }<br />&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
  <p>In this example, the middle layer may be prone to malicious attacks as the value of ISBN is not validated. The length of the string is not limited, which could lead to a buffer overflow in the unmanaged middle layer, and it may not be in the correct format, which could cause a middle layer string parser to crash, allow for format string attacks, SQL injection, or a host of other issues.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>In the following code, a page accepts a query string parameter called isbn. The value of this variable is used to look up a book in the database using an unmanaged middle layer. The code uses regular expressions to validate the query string string value. This ensures that the value supplied by the client is in the correct format by checking the length of the string and the characters used.</p>
  <pre>&lt;script language="C#" runat="server"&gt;<br />    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />    {<br />        String strIsbn = this.Request.QueryString["isbn"];<br />        if (Regex.IsMatch((strIsbn), @"(?=.{13}$)\d{1,5}([- ])\d{1,7}\1\d{1,6}\1(\d|X)$"))<br />        {<br />            //lookup isbn in a database using an<br />            //unamanged middle layer<br />        }<br />        else<br />        {<br />            //display error<br />        }<br />    }<br />&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Force the user to re-authenticate when executing security-critical functionality including, but not limited to, change of password, account modifications and critical transactions.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Forcing the user to re-authenticate verifies the user's decision to execute the given functionality and preserves the application's integrity in the event that a user's account has been compromised via session hijacking.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Force re-authentication prior to executing security-critical functionality.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Follow these steps when forcing re-authentication:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify critical functionality.</strong> Evaluate your application's design and requirements and determine what parts and resources of your application are very important to your organization's business model or your application's security architecture. This could include activities such as financial transactions or resetting user passwords.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Adopt re-authentication mechanism.</strong> Establish a mechanism that requires the user to verify their authenticity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Current password.</strong> The user uses their current password to confirm the identity. This technique ensures that the given user is aware of the action to be performed and holds responsibility for executing it. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CAPTCHA.</strong> CAPTCHA are mechanisms designed to ensure that a human, not an automated script, is using the system. Using a CAPTCHA should be seen as a way of augmenting a password in this kind of situation, not a way of replacing it. Many CAPTCHA systems embed distorted letters or numbers into displayed images which the user must enter. There are a number of problems with many CAPTCHA systems, so they should not be relied on too heavily. First, many graphical CAPTCHAs can be trivially broken by optical character recognition systems, and ensuring that a CAPTCHA is sufficiently strong to be useful without having too high of a failure rate for real users is difficult. If CAPTCHAs are reused, the attacker can simply record the session IDs of CAPTCHAs with known values and replay them. CAPTCHAs can also be broken by using a man-in-the-middle technique where the image is saved and forwarded to another site controlled by the attacker. An unsuspecting user of that site solves the CAPTCHA and the attacker forwards the answer to the victim site. CAPTCHAs also create accessibility problems for users, as blind and sometimes even color-blind individuals can find them impossible. If you choose to implement a CAPTCHA, be aware of the trade-offs involved and ensure that the system you use is appropriately protected against the attacks you expect to see.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>2nd Factor.</strong> If your application supports a second factor of authentication such as a token, this could play a role in the re-authentication scheme.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Enforce the re-authentication mechanism.</strong> Once the critical functionality is identified and the re-authentication mechanism is established, enforce the re-authentication mechanism before all security-critical actions.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code allows a user to change their credentials. Unfortunately, the code enters the new credentials into the credentials repository without verifying that it is the actual user changing the credentials.</p>
  <pre>public boolean changePassword(String user, char[] newPass)<br />{<br />       // The application fails to re-authenticate the user<br />       // Verify that new password meets password requirements<br />       // Update the credential store with the new password<br />}</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code allows a user to change their credentials. Before entering the new credentials into the credentials repository, the code verifies that it is the actual user doing the credentials change.</p>
  <pre>public boolean changePassword(String user, char[] oldPass, char[] newPass)<br />{<br />      // The application forces re-authentication<br />      if(!validateUser(user, oldPass))<br />      {<br />            return false;<br />      }<br />      // Verify that new password meets password requirements<br />      // Update the credential store with the new password<br />}</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use an encrypted communication channel to protect data sent between servers. SSL and IPSec can both be used under different circumstances to protect the communication traffic between servers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Servers may not necessarily co-exist in a secure environment. If the communication between&amp;nbsp;two or more servers&amp;nbsp;is not protected, the data sent between them could be compromised via eavesdropping or data manipulation.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your servers are not inside a physically secure data center where the network eavesdropping threat is considered insignificant. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Determine the level of desired granularity for the given server/application suite. If the protection needs to be applied across all applications, use IPSec. If the protection is granular and only a certain portion of the information exchanged between servers is sensitive use SSL. SSL and IPSec can both be used to help protect communication between servers by encrypting traffic. There are benefits to using a mixed approach consisting of both SSL and IPSec. See the related guidelines for specific details. </p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Avoid placing the validation procedures only on the client side. All input should be validated server side.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Client-side validation is executed by the client and can be easily bypassed. Client-side validation is a major design problem when it appears in web applications. It places trust in the browser, an entity that should never be trusted.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application accepts input from the client, always validate for length, range and type on the server.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Client-side validation should only be used to improve user experience, never for security purposes. A client-side input validation check can improve application performance by catching malformed input on the client and, therefore, saving a roundtrip to the server. However, client side validation can be easily bypassed and should never be used for security purposes. Always use server-side validation to protect your application from malicious attacks.</p>
  <p>Use the following steps when developing client side validation: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Never trust the browser.</strong> Because the browser is running on the user's machine, it can be fully controlled by the user. Therefore, any client-side validation code can be controlled and bypassed by an attacker.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use JavaScript only to enhance your pages.</strong> JavaScript is useful for enhancing your application's presentation. However, it has no mechanism to protect the integrity of its code. Do not rely on JavaScript to enforce security decisions. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Place a server-side validator for all input. </strong>Input validation should be executed on the server side. Use the following steps to properly set the validation routines: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Identify input.</strong> Determine the data that is to be passed from the client to your application. Input can take the following forms on the client-side:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>URL-based parameters </li>
            <li>Form-based parameters </li>
            <li>Hidden fields </li>
            <li>Cookies</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Understand the input.</strong> Understand the use and constraints associated with each input. Be clear how each input is used. Define the format and type of each input. Build a server-side validator for each format and type of expected input.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Create a set of validators.</strong> Build a validator for each type of input. Place the set of validators on the server-side of your application. If there are validators on the client-side, make sure the same validators are implemented on the server-side as well.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once developed, it is important to place the validation routines at your application's trust boundary. Because your application's trust boundary extends only to your application's process space, the user's browser should not be considered&amp;nbsp;a part of your application's trust boundary.</p>
      <p>Example of correctly set validation:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>&lt;%-- Filename: sample.jsp --%&gt;<br />&lt;%boolean validateJSP(String input)<br />{<br />      // Validation routine<br />}<br />String idx = request.getParameter("index");<br />if(idx != null &amp;&amp; validateJSP(idx))<br />{<br />      ...<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />      //Display a generic error message (e.g. "Invalid query.")<br />}<br />%&gt;<br /> ...<br />&lt;form method="post" action="sample.jsp"&gt;<br />  &lt;input name="index" type="text" size="50"&gt;<br />  &lt;input name="submit" value="submit" type="submit"&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code produces a data analysis based on a financial index. Unfortunately, the user's input is validated only on the client side via a JavaScript routine. Since there is no validation on the server, an attacker can bypass all validation and exploit cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities.</p>
  <blockquote>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Encrypt the communication channels when interacting with other software across the network.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Encrypting the communication links allows the application to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If sensitive data must be transmitted between two hosts, either&amp;nbsp;between servers or between application and server, then encrypt the communication links.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To encrypt the communication links:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the connections used for transmitting sensitive data. </strong>Enumerate all connections between the different servers with other servers or with the application. Identify the sensitive data that is sent over the network and the respective connections that are used for such communication.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose the appropriate encryption mechanism. </strong>Depending on the infrastructure, you may consider using IPSec or TLS/SSL.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>IPSec:</strong> IPSec is used when the encryption needs to be applied across all involved parties. Since IPSec is designed to secure connections between static hosts that are "always on," use IPSec to secure the network connections between your application's servers. Due to its nature, IPSec requires low level support; therefore, your application would need support from the operating system or a JNI component to manage it. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>TLS/SSL:</strong> TLS/SSL provides a granular protection which&amp;nbsp;allows only&amp;nbsp;the traffic containing sensitive data to be encrypted. Because TLS/SSL has a certificate based design, it allows the protection of data between mobile hosts. Use TLS/SSL to secure the communication channel between your application and its users.<br /><br />While Java provides APIs for handling SSL encrypted traffic, it is recommended to follow the manuals associated with the&amp;nbsp;third party software that&amp;nbsp;is being used. For example, if your application connects to a database server, follow the database server's manual on setting up the encryption; if your application is web-oriented, follow the web server's documentation on setting up the SSL certificate. If your application uses SSL, ensure that you use SSL 3.0 and disable the cryptographically weak SSL 2.0 protocols.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Apply the appropriate encryption mechanism. </strong>Apply the encryption mechanism of choice at the appropriate locations in the code. Such locations include all functionality that establishes a connection between your application and another entity.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code establishes a connection between&amp;nbsp;two servers. Unfortunately, the communication is not encrypted; therefore, it is possible for an attacker to eavesdrop on the connection.</p>
  <pre>String remoteHost = "server02.example.com";<br />int remotePort = "1337";<br /><br />Socket sock = new Socket(remoteHost, remotePort);<br />InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(sock.getInputStream());<br />BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(isr);<br />PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true);</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code establishes a connection between&amp;nbsp;two servers. Because the communication is encrypted, the confidentiality of the data in transit is preserved; therefore, it is impossible for an attacker to eavesdrop on the connection.</p>
  <pre>String remoteHost = "server02.example.com";<br />int remotePort = "1337";<br /><br />SSLSocketFactory sslSF = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();<br />SSLSocket sslSock = (SSLSocket) sslSF.createSocket(remoteHost, remotePort);<br /><br />InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(sslSock.getInputStream());<br />BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(isr);<br />PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(sslSocket.getOutputStream(), true);</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>You must protect the authentication cookie&amp;nbsp;with SSL. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>To prevent session hijacking and cookie replay attacks, secure the cookie by making sure that it is only passed over SSL connections using the HTTPS protocol. For additional risk mitigation, encrypt the cookie before sending it to the client and limit the period for which the cookie is valid. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>When&amp;nbsp;you use Forms authentication, make sure your application encrypts the authentication cookies using the <strong>protection="All"</strong> attribute on the <strong>&lt;forms&gt; </strong>element. This practice is recommended in addition to SSL to mitigate the risk of an XSS attack that manages to steal the authentication cookie of a user.&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Do not pass authentication cookies over HTTP connections. Set the secure cookie property within authentication cookies, which instructs browsers to send cookies back to the server only over HTTPS connections. For more information, see Chapter&amp;nbsp;10, "Building Secure ASP.NET Web Pages and Controls."</p>
  <p>Set the secure property by using <strong>requireSSL="true"</strong> on the <strong>&lt;forms&gt;</strong> element as follows:</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Validate destinations of redirects or forwards.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>If destinations of redirects or forwards are not validated, an attacker may create hyperlinks that appear to point to legitimate sites, but actually point to malicious pages controlled by the attacker. This technique is often used by phishers to trick people into visiting fake sites that steal authentication credentials. In some cases, a user may gain unauthorized access by manipulating redirect or forward parameters, if destinations are not validated.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Use this guideline when writing a web application that uses redirects or forwards. Avoid using redirects or forwards in web applications, if possible.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure validation of redirects and forwards:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify redirects and forwards.</strong> Review code to find all redirects and forwards.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Map destinations.</strong> Make a list of all destinations for each redirect and forward. Define mapping values for all destinations used by redirects and forwards. A mapping value is a short identifying string that symbolically represents a resource.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define access permissions.</strong> Determine circumstances under which it is acceptable for each user role to access each destination.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Validate redirects.</strong> Rewrite redirects and forwards to use mapping values as input to calculate the final destinations of redirects or forwards. Add validation routines to verify that the user has permissions to access the resource, which is the destination of the redirect or forward.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Do not store connection strings in plain text. Use a protected&amp;nbsp;configuration provider such as the RSA Protected Configuration Provider or the Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI)&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;encrypt connection strings before&amp;nbsp;storing them in configuration files. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Connection strings contain sensitive resource access credentials such as user names, passwords and server names. Connection strings stored in plaintext are dangerous, because an attacker that can compromise a server will be able to read those connection strings. Even if a machine is not compromised, connection strings stored in plain text&amp;nbsp;are accessible to administrators and any other users with sufficient privileges&amp;nbsp;on the host machine and/or Windows domain.&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Always encrypt connection strings. The Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) is the default provider and is&amp;nbsp;an acceptable choice under most circumstances. If&amp;nbsp;an application is deployed&amp;nbsp;within a Web farm environment,&amp;nbsp;the RSA-protected configuration provider is a better choice because it uses asymmetric, public&amp;nbsp;key encryption to encrypt and decrypt data keys that can easily be exported and imported across servers. If neither of these suffice, create a&amp;nbsp;custom provider. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>This section describes how to use DPAPI to encrypt connection strings. Please check the related guidelines for more information on using the RSA Protected Configuration Provider.&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose the appropriate configuration provider.</strong> Under most circumstances DPAPI will suffice, although the RSA protected configuration is the logical choice in web farms where multiple servers are employed. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the configuration sections to be encrypted.</strong> Encrypting and decrypting data incurs performance overhead. To keep this overhead to a minimum, encrypt only the sections of the configuration file that store sensitive data.&amp;nbsp; Encrypt the &lt;connectionStrings&gt; element of the Web.config file to protect the database connection string. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose the machine or user store.</strong> The DataProtectionConfigurationProvider supports machine-level and user-level stores for key storage. The choice of store depends largely on whether or not&amp;nbsp;the application shares a server with other applications and whether or not sensitive data must be kept private for each application.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Machine Store. </strong>By default, the DataProtectionConfigurationProvider is configured to use DPAPI with the machine store. Use machine-level key storage in the following situations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The application runs on its own dedicated server with no other applications. </li>
            <li>Multiple applications run on the same server&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;those applications need to be able to share sensitive information.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To encrypt the connectionStrings section&amp;nbsp;with the Machine Store, run the following command from a .NET command prompt:</p>
          <pre>   aspnet_regiis -pe "connectionStrings" -app "/MachineDPAPI" -prov "DataProtectionConfigurationProvider" </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>User Store. </strong>Use user-level key storage if the application runs in a shared hosting environment and the&amp;nbsp;application's sensitive data should&amp;nbsp;not be accessible to other applications on the server. In this situation, each application should run under a separate identity, and the resources for the application—such as files and databases—should be restricted to that identity.</p>
          <p>To encrypt the connectionStrings section&amp;nbsp;with the&amp;nbsp;User Store, run the following command from a .NET command prompt:</p>
          <pre>   aspnet_regiis -pe "connectionStrings" -app "/UserDPAPI" -prov "MyUserDataProtectionConfigurationProvider"</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Encrypt&amp;nbsp;the configuration file data.</strong>&amp;nbsp;To encrypt the connectionStrings section in Web.config using DPAPI with the Machine Store, run the following command from a .NET command prompt:</p>
      <pre>   aspnet_regiis -pe "connectionStrings" -app "/MachineDPAPI" -prov "DataProtectionConfigurationProvider" </pre>
      <p>The above command with the -app switch assumes that there is an IIS virtual directory called MachineDPAPI. If the Visual Studio .NET Web server is being utilized instead of IIS, use the -pef switch, which&amp;nbsp;specifies the physical directory location of&amp;nbsp;the configuration file.</p>
      <pre>   aspnet_regiis.exe -pef "connectionStrings" C:\Projects\MachineDPAPI -prov "DataProtectionConfigurationProvider"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>A web application is running in&amp;nbsp;a hosted web environment. The application uses an SQL database instance and has sensitive data that should not be accessible to&amp;nbsp;other applications on the same system.&amp;nbsp;The web.config file contains a connectionString section that&amp;nbsp;the application uses to access the SQL database:</p>
  <pre>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;<br />  &lt;add name="MyLocalSQLServer"<br />        connectionString="Initial Catalog=pubs;User Id=sa;Password=asdasd;<br />       data source=localhost;Integrated Security=SSPI;"<br />       providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/&gt;<br />&lt;/connectionStrings&gt;</pre>
  <p>Unfortunately,&amp;nbsp;anyone capable of reading the web.config file for the application is now able to see the database, the username, and the password for the database instance, and will be able to execute statements with the same privilege level as that of the application.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>A web application is running in&amp;nbsp;a hosted web environment. The application uses an SQL database instance and has sensitive data that should not be accessible to&amp;nbsp;other applications on the same system.&amp;nbsp;The web.config file contains a connectionString section that&amp;nbsp;the application uses to access the SQL database:</p>
  <pre>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;<br />  &lt;add name="MyLocalSQLServer"<br />        connectionString="Initial Catalog=pubs;User Id=sa;Password=asdasd;<br />       data source=localhost;Integrated Security=SSPI;"<br />       providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/&gt;<br />&lt;/connectionStrings&gt;</pre>
  <p>During deployment the connectionStrings section of web.config as been encrypted with DataProtectionConfigurationProvider and DPAPI. This was accomplished with the following command:</p>
  <pre>   aspnet_regiis -pe "connectionStrings" -app "/UserDPAPI" -prov "MyUserDataProtectionConfigurationProvider"</pre>
  <p>The connection string has been encrypted, which can be verified by looking at the web.config file. There is no need to decrypt the file by hand, since ASP.NET handles this transparently.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Do not send credentials via unencrypted connections. Use SSL when transmitting credentials.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using SSL prevents the credentials from being sniffed or tampered with as they are transmitted over the network.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application sends credentials on the Internet.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) over HTTP requires the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Create a certificate request.</strong> Using your hosting server or OpenSSL, generate an SSL certificate request. Example:</p>
      <pre># Generate private key<br />openssl genrsa -des3 -out privkey.pem 2048 <br /># Generate certificate request using private key<br />openssl req -new -key privkey.pem -out cert.csr</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Present the request to a Certification Authority (CA).</strong> If all conditions for obtaining an SSL certificate are met, the CA will produce a new SSL certificate based on the certificate request. Because the requirements for obtaining an SSL certificate depend on the Certification Authority, consult with the Certification Authority in regards to the administrative steps necessary for obtaining such certificate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Install the certificate.</strong> Consult with the hosting server's documentation on how to install the SSL certificate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Ensure credentials are sent over SSL.</strong> Place the authentication portion of your application on a dedicated subdomain. Configure the server to accept only HTTPS traffic for the authentication subdomain. Ensure that form posts containing credentials are sent over HTTPS. This is accomplished by using absolute URL paths in the action field. Example:</p>
      <pre>&lt;form method="POST" action="https://login.example.com/myapp/login"&gt;</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>In the following snippet, the credentials are transmitted over unprotected HTTP. This allows an attacker to easily steal credentials from sniffed traffic.</p>
  <pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />  &lt;head&gt;<br />    &lt;title&gt;login form&lt;/title&gt;<br />  &lt;/head&gt;<br />  &lt;body&gt;<br />    &lt;form method="POST" action="http://login.example.com/myapp/login"&gt;<br />    &lt;input type="text" name="user" size=25&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />    &lt;input type="password" name="pass" size=25&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />    &lt;input type="submit" name="submit" value="log in"&gt;<br />    &lt;/form&gt;<br />  &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>In the following snippet, the credentials are transmitted over HTTPS. This makes it difficult for an attacker to steal credentials from sniffed traffic:</p>
  <pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />  &lt;head&gt;<br />    &lt;title&gt;login form&lt;/title&gt;<br />  &lt;/head&gt;<br />  &lt;body&gt;<br />    &lt;form method="POST" action="https://login.example.com/myapp/login"&gt;<br />    &lt;input type="text" name="user" size=25&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />    &lt;input type="password" name="pass" size=25&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />    &lt;input type="submit" name="submit" value="log in"&gt;<br />    &lt;/form&gt;<br />  &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Define a boundary between public and restricted content.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Defining a boundary between public and restricted content helps establish the check points&amp;nbsp;where access will be allowed&amp;nbsp;to the restricted content.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application has access control that&amp;nbsp;restricts certain users to specific resources, then define a boundary between those resources. For instance, anonymous users are restricted&amp;nbsp;to one part of the application, while&amp;nbsp;authenticated users can access both parts.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Defining the boundary requires:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Determine roles. </strong>Define the various types of users and their rights. Build a security policy for the restricted content and base the user groups' privileges around it. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define the boundary. </strong>Structure the content according to access and logical orders. Try to use a modular approach when establishing the boundary. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Separate on disk. </strong>Once the boundaries have been established, reflect these boundaries onto the local file system. Separate the restricted content from the public content on disk. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set proper permissions. </strong>Set proper permissions to the restricted content. Dedicate a special directory for the restricted content and require valid access before accessing content within this directory. These permissions can be enforced at the application, server and operating system levels, depending on the environment in use.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Configure access control lists (ACLs) on your Web site files so that IIS and ASP.NET file authorization appropriately control access to these files.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Failure to apply proper&amp;nbsp;access control restrictions on files&amp;nbsp;may allow users&amp;nbsp;to read, edit,&amp;nbsp;or remove files they should not be able to.&amp;nbsp;ACLs are an important layer of defense against unauthorized file&amp;nbsp;access.&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All ASP.NET applications can benefit from appropriate file ACLs.&amp;nbsp;ACLs should be established&amp;nbsp;in the&amp;nbsp;design&amp;nbsp;phase, prior to&amp;nbsp;implementing the application.&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;ACLs&amp;nbsp;are applied at deploy time.&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>You need to configure the right access control lists (ACLs) for the right identities on your Web site files so that IIS and also ASP.NET file authorization control access to these files appropriately. You need to grant access to the following identities: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Your Web application identity.</strong> If you are using a custom service account to run your ASP.NET application, you can grant the appropriate permissions to the IIS metabase and to the file system by running Aspnet_regiis.exe with the-<strong>ga</strong> switch. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Your application's users.</strong> ASP.NET file authorization performs access checks for file types mapped by IIS to the ASP.NET ISAPI extension (Aspnet_isapi.dll). If you are using Windows authentication, the authenticated user's Windows access token (which may be IUSR_MACHINE for anonymous users) is checked against the ACL attached to the requested ASP.NET file. If you are using forms authentication, access is checked against IUSR_MACHINE.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Use the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Determine the users/roles that need to access the application's resources.</strong> Create a list of all roles in the application.&amp;nbsp;The Web application's process&amp;nbsp;identity and the application's users are the entities that&amp;nbsp;require access to application resources. If&amp;nbsp;a custom service account is being utilised to run&amp;nbsp;the ASP.NET application be sure to list it as well, it will need the appropriate permissions to the IIS metabase and the file system.&amp;nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Evaluate the level of access each user/role should have to use the application resources.</strong> It is important to assign the minimum privilege level for all entities that access resources.&amp;nbsp; To do this create a table that contains roles on one axis and resources on another.&amp;nbsp; Within the&amp;nbsp;matrix cells describe the level of access each role will need for each resource (eg. Read Only, Read/Write, Full Access, etc.).&amp;nbsp; This is commonly called a subject/object matrix:</p>
      <p />
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>

            </td>
            <td>Create, Delete, Modify, Read</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <strong>Reader</strong>
            </td>
            <td>
            </td>
            <td>Read</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <strong>Anonymous</strong>
            </td>
            <td>
            </td>
            <td>Read</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p />
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Apply ACLs to enforce these restrictions.</strong> To assign ASP.NET permissions to the&amp;nbsp;application's account, run the following command:</p>
      <pre>aspnet_regiis -ga MachineName\AccountName </pre>
      <p>Where MachineName is the name of your server or the domain name if you are using a domain account, and AccountName is the name of your custom account. When you run Aspnet_regiis.exe with the -ga switch, the command grants the following rights to the account:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <div>Access to the IIS Metabase</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>Permission to write to the %Windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\version\Temporary ASP.NET Files folder</div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The account is also a member of the local Users group; therefore, it has read access to the \Inetpub directory tree (these directories have an ACL that grants read access to the Users group).&amp;nbsp;</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Application keys should be stored in a well defined location, such as the Java <i>KeyStore</i>. Do not hard code them or store them as plaintext inside configuration files or source code.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>When faced with encryption, intruders attack the most vulnerable aspect: key management. Because keys are used to generate the encryption that protects sensitive data, the keys themselves become sensitive data that needs to be protected.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application uses encryption and encryption keys, use a secure storage location for the keys.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>When considering a key storage location:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the need for a key store. </strong>Key stores should be used when your application utilizes crypto keys. Example:</p>
      <pre>KeyGenerator kgen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");<br />kgen.init(256);SecretKey skey = kgen.generateKey();<br />byte[] rawKey = skey.getEncoded();<br /><br />SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(rawKey, "AES");</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use Java's <i>KeyStore </i>class. </strong>Since version 1.2, Java offers a key store functionality as part of the Java Runtime Environment. The Java key store requires a master password for retrieving the contents of the key store. The master password should be given to the application at starting time. Use the <i>KeyTool </i>utility to create and manage the keys inside the key store. Example of accessing the key store:</p>
      <pre>String keyStoreName = MyApp.getKeyStoreName();<br />char[] keyStorePass = MyApp.getKeyStorePass();<br />KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());<br />FileInputStream keyStoreFile = new FileInputStream(keyStoreName);<br />keyStore.load(keyStoreFile, keyStorePass);<br />keyStoreFile.close();<br /><br />final String keyName = "MyAppEncryptionKey";<br />// Note: Although the example uses the same password for storing the KeyStore<br />// on disk and adding keys to the KeyStore, the 2 passwords can be different<br />// from one another<br />SecretKey skey = (SecretKey)keyStore.getKey(keyName, keyStorePass);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Protect the key store.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose a key store directory</strong>: Dedicate a directory for storing your application's key store files. Make sure the directory is not web-accessible. This limits the scope of users&amp;nbsp;who can potentially compromise the contents inside the directory. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set appropriate permissions</strong>: Apply filesystem permissions such that the key store files can be only accessed by your application and its administrators.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Avoid common mistakes.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Do not hard-code keys in the application</strong>: Hard-coding the encryption keys into the source code, hoping that an attacker will not reverse engineer the application, is security through obscurity. A determined attacker will usually find a way to defeat such a mechanism. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Do not place keys into configuration files</strong>: Obfuscating the encryption keys and placing them into configuration files is security through obscurity. A determined attacker will usually find a way to defeat such a mechanism. </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unload keys from memory after their use</strong>: Leaving the encryption keys in memory after their final use allows the operating system to page them from memory and onto the hard drive. A determined attacker will usually find a way to obtain the encryption keys from the operating system's page file.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code shows a hard-coded encryption key inside the application. A determined attacker will be able to compromise the key once they gain access to the source code.</p>
  <pre>String encKey = "encryption key";<br />MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-512");<br />md.update(encKey.getBytes("UTF-8"));<br />byte[] rawKey = md.digest();<br />md.reset();<br />SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(rawKey, "AES");</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code loads the encryption key from the Java key store. Because the key is properly stored, it is impossible for an attacker to steal the actual key without also stealing the master password.</p>
  <pre>String keyStoreName = MyApp.getKeyStoreName();<br />char[] keyStorePass = MyApp.getKeyStorePass(); <br />KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());<br />FileInputStream keyStoreFile = new FileInputStream(keyStoreName);<br />keyStore.load(keyStoreFile, keyStorePass);<br />keyStoreFile.close();<br /> final String keyName = "MyAppEncryptionKey";<br />// Note: Although the example uses the same password for storing the KeyStore<br />// on disk and adding keys to the KeyStore, the 2 passwords can be different <br />// from one another<br />SecretKey skey = (SecretKey)keyStore.getKey(keyName, keyStorePass);<br /></pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Protect the confidentiality of session cookies.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Session cookies are used by an application to identify the session associated with a particular user. Protecting session cookies can help prevent an attacker from hijacking the session and using the application as a legitimate user.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application uses cookies to maintain a user's session state, then use this guideline to protect the cookie.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to secure session cookies:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Do not allow users to choose their own session identifiers. </strong>Java automatically assigns random IDs to its sessions which minimizes the risk of an attacker hijacking another user's session by using the same session ID. To use sessions in Java, invoke <em>HttpServletRequest.getSession</em>:</p>
      <pre>HttpSession session = request.getSession();</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <p>
          <strong>Invalidate the session identifier on login (as well as logout) to ensure session identifiers are not reused.</strong> This is a portion of the approach necessary to prevent session hijacking. Use <em>HttpSession.invalidate</em> to accomplish this. After the session has been invalidated, the call below will generate a new session identifier.</p>
      </span>
      <pre>HttpSession session = getSession(false);
if(session != null) session.Invalidate();
session = request.getSession(true);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Time-out sessions. </strong>
      <span>Set an expiration time for sessions. This helps minimize the threat of session hijacking by giving an attacker a smaller window of opportunity. Depending on your application, an appropriate timeout can be anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes. Setting when sessions should expire can be done through <em>HttpSession.setMaxInactiveInterval</em> in code, or via the <em>session-timeout</em> configuration in the web.xml file.<p /></span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Allow users to terminate their sessions. </strong>Allowing users to invalidate their sessions reduces the risk of session being hijacked. Use <em>HttpSession.invalidate</em> to accomplish this.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Ensure cookies are sent over encrypted channels. </strong>
      <span>Mark cookies sent over SSL as <em>Secure</em>. Use <em>Cookie.setSecure</em> to require SSL when sending out the given cookie. It is recommended to avoid sending session cookies over unencrypted channels as session hijacking is made much easier. Use <em>ServletRequest.isSecure</em> to verify whether SSL is being used. There is a <em>cookie-secure</em> attribute that can be set for the sessiond id cookie in the web.xml file.<p /></span>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> PCI DSS requirements state that sessions that are idle for 15 minutes should be locked automatically and require the user's password to unlock.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code shows the logout function of the <em>LoginModule</em> used when relying on JAAS for authentication. The code removes all authentication tokens associated with the current session but fails to invalidate the session. </p>
  <pre>public boolean logout() throws LoginException{<br />      subject.getPrincipals().remove(userToken);<br /><br />      clearCredentials();<br />      userToken = null;<br /><br />      // The application should have invalidated the session here.<br />      // Log the logout event. Consult the Logging section for more details<br />      return true;<br />}</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code shows the logout function of the <em>LoginModule</em> used when relying on JAAS for authentication. The code removes all authentication tokens associated with the current session and invalidates the session.</p>
  <pre>public boolean logout() throws LoginException{<br />      subject.getPrincipals().remove(userToken);<br /><br />      clearCredentials();<br />      userToken = null;<br /><br />      // The application invalidates the session when<br />      // the user is logging out<br />      HttpSession session = common.getCurrentSession();<br />      session.invalidate();<br /><br />      // Log the logout event. Consult the Logging section for more details<br />      return true;<br />}</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Define a boundary between public and restricted content in both the URL namespace and the filesystem namespace.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Defining a boundary between public and restricted content simplifies the task of user authorization and is generally less prone to error. When the content is separated, server configuration can be used to automatically apply authorization rules without relying on the developer to explicitly add checks in the code.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Consider using this guideline when your application restricts access to specific resources. For instance, anonymous users are granted access to some, but not all of the application while authenticated users are granted access based on their role.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Defining the boundary requires: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Determine roles</strong>: Define the various types of users and their rights. Build a security policy that documents the rights required to access each page of your application.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Determine pages that should require SSL</strong>: This would include pages that transmit credentials, unprotected authentication cookies, or sensitive user information such as credit card or social security numbers. Such pages should be transmitted over SSL only.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that the Forms Authentication cookie is unprotected in the sense that it is vulnerable to HTTP Replay Attacks. As such, any page in a Forms Auth ASP.Net application that requires an authenticated user should only be accessible over SSL.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Structure the URL namespace</strong>: Structure the application URL namespace to first separate the pages that require SSL from those that do not. Then define separate directories according to the various roles defined for your application. For instance you might have the following directories under your application root:</p>
      <pre>//secure/usr/secure/admin</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Configure IIS to require SSL on the appropriate portions of your application</strong>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Right-click on 'My Computer' and select 'Manage </li>
        <li>Under the 'Services and Applications' node, expand 'Internet Information Services' and locate your website </li>
        <li>Right click on the restricted folder and choose 'Properties' </li>
        <li>Click on 'Edit' under the 'Secure Communications' section to require SSL connections. (NOTE: If you have not installed configured a certificate for this server, see the related section for steps to setup SSL on your IIS website)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use absolute URLs to transition to or from the sensitive portion of the namespace</strong>: Relative links use the same protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) as the current page. This can result in broken links that point to pages within your application that require SSL. It can also lead to unnecessary use of SSL, which does have an associated performance hit.</p>
      <p>The fix for both of these issues is to use absolute URLs that explicitly specify the protocol instead of relative URLs. An example redirection using an absolute URL is shown below.</p>
      <pre>private void btnLogon_Click( object sender, System.EventArgs e ){// Form an absolute path using the server name and v-dir namestring serverName = HttpUtility.UrlEncode(Request.ServerVariables["SERVER_NAME"]);string vdirName = Request.ApplicationPath;Response.Redirect("https://" + serverName + vdirName + "/Restricted/Login.aspx");}</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use URL Authorization Restrict Access</strong>: Use an <strong>&lt;authorization&gt;</strong> element to ensure that only authenticated users can access secure pages. Place this element beneath the closing <strong>&lt;/system.web&gt;</strong> tag, as shown here.</p>
      <pre>&lt;!-- The secure folder is for authenticated and SSL access only. --&gt;&lt;location path="Secure" &gt;  &lt;system.web&gt;    &lt;authorization&gt;      &lt;deny users="?" /&gt;    &lt;/authorization&gt;  &lt;/system.web&gt;&lt;/location&gt;</pre>
      <p>Additionally, the following configuration ensures that unauthenticated users are allowed to access pages in the application's root directory. Place this configuration in the main <strong>&lt;system.web&gt;</strong> element.</p>
      <pre>&lt;system.web&gt;  &lt;!-- The virtual directory root folder contains general pages.       Unauthenticated users can view them and they do not need        to be secured with SSL. --&gt;  &lt;authorization&gt;    &lt;allow users="*" /&gt;  &lt;/authorization&gt;&lt;/system.web&gt;</pre>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> If you use this type of site structure, your application must not rely on the user's identity on the non-SSL pages. In the preceding configuration, no forms authentication ticket is sent for requests for non-SSL pages. As a result, the user is considered anonymous. This has implications for related features, such as personalization, that require the user name.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>MyApp is a financial tool that generates reports based on sensitive data. It allows the user to upload the financial data and download the report. Since the application is small, all of its content is located within the same directory. The access control is enforced by the web application through checking the required permissions before a given call is executed.</p>
  <p>Since both data and code is within the same directory, it may be possible for an attacker to gain access to the raw financial data.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>MyApp is a financial tool that generates reports based on some sensitive data. It allows the user to upload the financial data and download the report. The application has a dedicated /data/ directory for the financial data. Access to contents within the /data/ directory is handled by the server hosting MyApp, making it much more difficult for an unauthorized user to gain access.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use a protocol that allows adequate encryption to protect sensitive data, such as credentials and application-specific data.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>When data is sent over the network, it typically passes through several intermediate relays on its way towards some final destination. Using a safe protocol to transmit information is important because it adds protection against&amp;nbsp;the Network Eavesdropping Attack or the&amp;nbsp;Man in the Middle Attack during transport.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>This is required whenever sensitive data needs to be sent between two hosts.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to protect sensitive data over the network:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive information.</strong> Sensitive data is any information that is kept secret and should be disclosed only to authorized parties. Common examples of sensitive data include, but are not limited to, names of customers, government issued ID numbers, credit card and other financial information, passwords, and private keys. Some industries, such as health care and banking, have regulatory standards that define sensitive information. Use regulatory requirements, as they apply to your application, to identify sensitive data. Sensitive data can be defined as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information that either contains personally identifiable information or can be used to derive personally identifiable information that should not be shared with others. </li>
        <li>Information that a user provides that they would not want shared with other users of the application. </li>
        <li>Information that comes from an external trusted source that is not designed to be shared with users.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose an appropriate protection mechanism.</strong> Choosing the appropriate protection mechanism may depend on various conditions: purpose of the sensitive data, role of the other network party, infrastructure, and supported technologies. Because sensitive data must be encrypted when in transit, there are two potential strategies — Encrypt the application data or Encrypt the communication channel:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Encrypt the communication channel.</strong> Depending on the current infrastructure and the other network party, it is possible to encrypt the connections using SSL, IPSec, or any technologies supported by the remote party. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Encrypt the application data.</strong> If your application's communication channels cannot be encrypted, encrypt the application data. Hashing or encryption should be used when protecting the application data. Use hashing if the sensitive data will be used only for comparison purposes and the actual contents of the data will never need to be recovered. Use encryption if the sensitive data will need be retrieved at a later stage.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Hashing</strong>: If hashing is used, choose a longer salt, 16 or more bits. The salt is random data that is known only by the application; to guess the value of the original data given the hash, an attacker also has to guess the salt. It is recommended to have a longer salt because it provides a bigger input to the hash function. Assuming that the produced hash is compromised, longer salts makes it more difficult for an attacker to gain access to the sensitive data. If your application uses randomly generated salt, make sure that your application encrypts the random salt and stores it into a configuration file. Use RNGCryptoServiceProvider to generate the salt. Example:</p>
              <pre>public static byte[] GenerateSalt()<br />{<br />    byte[] randBytes = new byte[4];<br />    RNGCryptoServiceProvider gen =<br />     new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();<br />    gen.GetNonZeroBytes(randBytes);<br />    return randBytes;<br />}</pre>
              <p>Choosing a strong hashing algorithm is also important. Stronger algorithms prevent multiple unique pieces of data from producing identical hash values. The current recommendation is to use SHA-256 or stronger.</p>
              <pre>public byte[] HashCredentials(byte[] pass, byte[] salt)<br />{<br />    HMACSHA512 md;<br />    byte[] digest; <br />    md = new HMACSHA256(salt);<br />    md.Initialize();<br />    digest = md.ComputeHash(pass);<br />    md.Clear();<br />    return digest;<br />}</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Encrypting</strong>: If encryption is used, use a key size of 256-bit or higher for symmetric encryption and 2048-bit or higher for public/private key encryption. Use AES for symmetric encryption or RSA for public/private key encryption. You should use symmetric encryption if and only if your application is the only entity that will access the encrypted data. If the data will be accessed by more than one parties, use public/private key encryption. Public/private key encryption allows your application to share sensitive data with multiple entities without disclosing its own encryption key. The following example demonstrates the use of the Rijndael symmetric key encryption algorithm:</p>
              <pre>Rijndael encMD;<br />ICryptoTransform encCT;<br />byte[] digest;<br />// The following code obtains the encryption<br />// key and initialization vector<br />// from the application's key repository. <br />encMD = Rijndael.Create();<br />encMD.Key = MyApp.Crypto.GetEncryptionKey();<br />encMD.IV = MyApp.Crypto.GetEncryptionIV();<br />encCT = encMD.CreateEncryptor(); <br />// Note that sensitiveData is of type byte[] and contains<br />// data that is sensitive in nature<br />digest =<br /> encCT.TransformFinalBlock(sensitiveData, 0, sensitiveData.Length);<br />encMD.Clear();</pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Apply the appropriate protection mechanism</strong>: Evaluate the code and determine the places where sensitive data is transmitted. Apply the established protection mechanism at each location. For instance, if your application processes credit card transactions across a hostile network environment, encrypt the credit card information before transmitting it to the appropriate network entity:</p>
      <pre>void ProcessPayment(byte[] ccInfo, float amount)<br />{<br />    byte[] ccDigest = MyApp.Crypto.EncryptCCInfo(ccInfo);<br />    SqlConnection connection;<br />    SqlCommand command;<br />    SqlDataReader result;<br />    string query = "execute QueuePayment @ccDigest @amount;";<br />    connection = MyApp.DBManager.GetDBConnection();<br />    command = new SqlCommand(query, connection);<br />    command.Parameters.Add("@ccDigest", System.Data.SqlDbType.Binary);<br />    command.Parameters["@ccDigest"].Value = ccDigest;<br />    command.Parameters.Add("@amount", System.Data.SqlDbType.Float);<br />    command.Parameters["@amount"].Value = amount;<br />    ...<br />}</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An e-commerce application written in ASP.NET enables customers to pay their bills online through a unified broker. The application's web component relies on an independent account management system that resides on another server. The web component communicates with the account management system using a SQL socket connection. The two servers are located in a competitively priced data center that houses a number of other customers, all of which are able to access the building at all times. A malicious user purchases hosting services at the same company, and after exploring the hosting environment, learns that the hosted accounts are networked using a shared bus topology that allows for network snooping. Because SQL connections are not encrypted by default, the attacker is able to setup a sniffer and capture all of the communication between the account management component and the web component. This enabled the attacker to login as a legitimate user on the account management server and make changes at will.</p>

  <p>Because data between the two components is encrypted, the transmission medium is less likely to affect the application's ability to securely transmit payment information.</p>

  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn about key changes for encrypting sensitive data in configuration files in ASP.NET. </li>
    <li>Learn how to choose between machine-level and user-level containers. </li>
    <li>Know which sections can and cannot be encrypted with the RSA protected configuration provider. </li>
    <li>Use the RSA protected configuration provider to encrypt connection strings. </li>
    <li>Create RSA key containers. </li>
    <li>Import and export RSA keys across multiple servers in a Web farm. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>Configuration files such as the Web.config file are often used to hold sensitive information, including user names, passwords, database connection strings, and encryption keys. The sections that usually contain sensitive information that you need to encrypt are the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&lt;appSettings&gt;. This section contains custom application settings. </li>
    <li>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;. This section contains connection strings. </li>
    <li>&lt;identity&gt;. This section can contain impersonation credentials. </li>
    <li>&lt;sessionState&gt;. This section contains the connection string for the out-of-process session state provider. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Encrypting and decrypting data incurs performance overhead. To keep this overhead to a minimum, encrypt only the sections of your configuration file that store sensitive data.</p>
  <h1>Summary of Steps</h1>
  <p>To encrypt configuration sections by using the RSA protected configuration provider, perform the following steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step 1. Identify the configuration sections to be encrypted. </li>
    <li>Step 2. Choose machine-level or user-level key containers. </li>
    <li>Step 3. Encrypt your configuration file data. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Step 1. Identify the Configuration Sections to Be Encrypted</h1>
  <p>Encrypting and decrypting data incurs performance overhead. To keep this overhead to a minimum, encrypt only the sections of your configuration file that store sensitive data.</p>
  <h2>Sections You Cannot Encrypt Using Protected Configuration</h2>
  <p>If you store sensitive data in any of the following configuration sections, you cannot encrypt it by using a protected configuration provider and the Aspnet_regiis.exe tool:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&lt;processModel&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;runtime&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;mscorlib&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;startup&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;system.runtime.remoting&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;configProtectedData&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;satelliteassemblies&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;cryptographySettings&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;cryptoNameMapping&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;cryptoClasses&gt; </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For the configuration sections listed, you should use the Aspnet_setreg.exe tool, which is also available for previous versions of the .NET Framework.</p>
  <h1>Step 2. Choose Machine-Level or User-Level Key Containers</h1>
  <p>The <strong>RSAProtectedConfigurationProvider</strong> supports machine-level and user-level key containers for key storage. Machine-level key containers are available to all users, but a user-level key container is available to that user only.</p>
  <p>The choice of container depends largely on whether or not your application shares a server with other applications and whether or not sensitive data must be kept private for each application.</p>
  <h2>Machine Key Container</h2>
  <p>Use a machine-level key container in the following situations: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your application runs on its own dedicated server with no other applications. </li>
    <li>You have multiple applications on the same server and you want those applications to be able to share sensitive information and the same encryption key. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>RSA machine key containers are stored in the following folder: </p>
  <p>\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys</p>
  <h2>User Key Container</h2>
  <p>Use a user-level key container if you run your application in a shared hosting environment and you want to make sure that your application's sensitive data is not accessible to other applications on the server. In this situation, each application should have a separate identity and the resources for the application—such as files, and databases—should be restricted to that identity.</p>
  <p>RSA user-level key containers are stored in the following folder:</p>
  <p>\Documents and Settings\{UserName}\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA</p>
  <h1>Step 3. Encrypt Your Configuration File Data</h1>
  <p>This step shows you how to encrypt a connection string in the Web.config file. It shows you how to do this with the machine store and then with the user store.</p>
  <h2>Using RSA with a Machine-Level Key Container to Encrypt a Connection String in Web.Config</h2>
  <p>The <strong>RSAProtectedConfigurationProvider</strong> is the default provider and is configured to use the machine-level key container.</p>
  <h3>To encrypt the connectionStrings section in Web.config </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new Web site named MachineRSA. Make sure that this directory is configured as a virtual directory. </li>
    <li>Add a Web.config configuration file to this directory. </li>
    <li>Add a sample <strong>connectionString</strong> similar to the following example: <div><pre>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;add name="MyLocalSQLServer" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connectionString="Initial Catalog=aspnetdb;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; data source=localhost;Integrated Security=SSPI;" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/&gt;<br />&lt;/connectionStrings&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>Run the following command from a .NET command prompt to encrypt the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section: <p><strong>aspnet_regiis -pe "connectionStrings" -app "/MachineRSA"</strong></p><p>The above command with the-<strong>app</strong> switch assumes that there is an IIS virtual directory called MachineRSA. If you are using the Visual Studio Web server instead of IIS, use the-<strong>pef</strong> switch, which allows you to specify the physical directory location of your configuration file. </p><p><strong>aspnet_regiis.exe -pef "connectionStrings" C:\Projects\MachineRSA</strong></p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Aspnet_regiis.exe utility tool is located in the following directory:</blockquote><blockquote>%WinDir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\&lt;<em>versionNumber</em>&gt;</blockquote><ul><li>The <strong>-pe</strong> switch specifies the configuration section to encrypt. This is the XML element name of the configuration section. <p>For nested elements, such as the &lt;<strong>pages</strong>&gt; section which is inside &lt;<strong>system.web</strong>&gt;, the XML name must include the containing section groups; for example: <strong>"system.web/pages"</strong>. </p></li><li>The <strong>-pef</strong> switch specifies the configuration section to encrypt and allows you to supply the physical directory path for your configuration file. </li><li>The <strong>-app</strong> switch specifies your Web application's virtual path. If it is a nested application, you need to specify the nested path from the root directory; for example, <strong>"/test/aspnet/MachineRSA"</strong>. </li><li>Because you are using the default provider with default settings, you do not need to use the-<strong>prov</strong> switch, which specifies the provider name. </li></ul><p>If the command is successful, you will see the following output: </p><div><pre>Encrypting configuration section...Succeeded!  </pre></div><blockquote><strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The RSA machine key containers are stored in the following folder:</blockquote><blockquote>\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys</blockquote></li>
    <li>Review the Web.config file, and examine the changes. The following elements are created: <ul><li>&lt;<strong>EncryptedData</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>EncryptionMethod</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>KeyInfo</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>EncryptedKey</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>KeyName</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>CipherData</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>CipherValue</strong>&gt; </li></ul><p>Your modified Web.Config file, with the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section encrypted, should be similar to the following example: </p><div><pre>...<br />&lt;connectionStrings configProtectionProvider="RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptedData Type="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#Element"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;              xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptionMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#tripledes-cbc" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;KeyInfo xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptedKey xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptionMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#rsa-1_5" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;KeyInfo xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;KeyName&gt;Rsa Key&lt;/KeyName&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/KeyInfo&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherValue&gt;R7cyuRk+SXJoimz7wlOpJr/YLeADGnwJVcmElHbrG/<br />                         B5dDTE4C9rzSmmTsbJ9Xcl2oDQt1qYma9L7pzQsQQYqLrkajqJ4i6ZQH1cmiot8ja7Vh+yItes7TRU1AoXN9T0mbX5H1Axm0O3X/<br />                         285/MdXXTUlPkDMAZXmzNVeEJHSCE=<br />            &lt;/CipherValue&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EncryptedKey&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/KeyInfo&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherValue&gt;d2++QtjcVwIkJLsye+dNJbCveORxeWiVSJIbcQQqAFofhay1wMci8FFlbQWttiRYFcvxrmVfNSxoZV8GjfPtppiodhOzQZ+0/<br />                     QIFiU9Cifqh/T/7JyFkFSn13bTKjbYmHObKAzZ+Eg6gCXBxsVErzH9GRphlsz5ru1BytFYxo/<br />                     lUGRvZfpLHLYWRuFyLXnxNoAGfL1mpQM7M46x5YWRMsNsNEKTo/PU9/Jvnh/<br />                     lT+GlcgCs2JRpyzSfKE7zSJH+TpIRtd86PwQ5HG3Pd2frYdYw0rmlmlI9D<br />        &lt;/CipherValue&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EncryptedData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;<br />...</pre></div></li>
    <li>Add the following Default.aspx Web page to your application's virtual directory, and then browse to this page to verify that encryption and decryption work correctly. <div><pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" %&gt;<br />&lt;script runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write("Clear text connection string is: " + <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;       ConfigurationManager.ConnectionString["MyLocalSQLServer"].ConnectionString);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;body /&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>
      <p>MyLocalSQLServer is the name of the connection string you previously specified in the Web.config file. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If your ASP.NET application identity does not have access to the .NET Framework configuration key store, the following message is returned:</blockquote>

  <h2>Using RSA with a User-level Key Container to Encrypt a Connection String in Web.config</h2>
  <p>The following steps show you how to encrypt a &lt;<strong>connectionStrings</strong>&gt; section by using the <strong>RSAProtectedConfigurationProvider</strong> (RSA) with a user-level key container.</p>
  <p>By default, the ASP.NET applications run under the NT AUTHORITY \ Network Service account. When you access encrypted configuration sections using RSA encryption with the user-level key container, make sure that your application is running with the same user identity as the account you used to encrypt the data. </p>
  <h3>To encrypt the connectionStrings section in Web.config </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new Web site named UserRSA. Make sure that this directory is configured as a virtual directory. </li>
    <li>Add a Web.config configuration file to this directory. </li>
    <li>Add a sample <strong>connectionString</strong> similar to the following example: <div><pre>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;add name="MyLocalSQLServer" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connectionString="Initial Catalog=aspnetdb;data source=localhost;Integrated Security=SSPI;"<br />       providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" /&gt;<br />&lt;/connectionStrings&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>Add and configure a protected configuration provider to use a user-level key container. To do this, add the following &lt;<strong>configProtectedData</strong>&gt; section to your Web.config file. You must set <strong>useMachineContainer</strong>=<strong> "false"</strong> to instruct the provider to use the user-level key container. You must also use a unique provider name or a run-time error will be generated. <div><pre>&lt;configProtectedData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;providers&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;add keyContainerName="NetFrameworkConfigurationKey"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    useMachineContainer="false"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    description="Uses RsaCryptoServiceProvider to encrypt and decrypt"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    name="MyUserRSAProtectedConfigurationprovider" <br />         type="System.Configuration.RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider,System.Configuration,<br />               Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/providers&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&lt;/configProtectedData&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>Run the following command from an SDK Command Prompt to encrypt the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section: <p><strong>aspnet_regiis -pe "connectionStrings" -app "/UserRSA" -prov "MyUserRSAProtectedConfigurationProvider"</strong></p><ul><li>The <strong>-pe</strong> switch specifies the configuration section to encrypt. This is the XML element name of the configuration section. <p>For nested elements, such as the &lt;<strong>pages</strong>&gt; section, which is inside &lt;<strong>system.web</strong>&gt;, the XML name must include the containing section groups; for example, <strong>"system.web/pages"</strong>. </p></li><li>The <strong>-app</strong> switch specifies your Web application's virtual path. If it is a nested application, you need to specify the nested path from the root directory; for example, <strong>"/test/aspnet/MachineRSA"</strong>. </li><li>The <strong>-prov</strong> switch specifies the provider name. In this case, this is set to <strong>"MyUserRSAProtectedConfigurationProvider"</strong> which is the name you specified when configuring the provider in step 4. </li></ul><p>If the command is successful, you will see the following output: </p><div><pre>Encrypting configuration section...Succeeded!  </pre></div><blockquote><strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;RSA user-level key containers are stored in the following folder.</blockquote><blockquote>\Documents and Settings\{UserName}\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA</blockquote></li>
    <li>Review the Web.config and examine the changes. The following elements are created. <ul><li>&lt;<strong>EncryptedData</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>EncryptionMethod</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>KeyInfo</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>EncryptedKey</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>KeyName</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>CipherData</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>CipherValue</strong>&gt; </li></ul><p>Your modified Web.Config file, with the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section encrypted, should be similar to the following example: </p><div><pre>...<br />  &lt;connectionStrings configProtectionProvider="MyUserRSAProtectedConfigurationprovider"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptedData Type="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#Element"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;              xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptionMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#tripledes-cbc" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;KeyInfo xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptedKey xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptionMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#rsa-1_5" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;KeyInfo xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;KeyName&gt;Rsa Key&lt;/KeyName&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/KeyInfo&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherValue&gt;In7jNc0GA1eE5nvVR2hrHQ6cC1O1kMbfBXH0alBwlY2OBM4sMa8NbK4pBnUdxFkrx+oSzLYE8SHS6dYZwE3Uf5x7hk46Jx+Z/<br />                         hn1hneWMyxWn23t41708lQzySsotYnzL5VOdR4P7MrIlhW9eSpbWp7PopSzcLxlGbs41dH7L3E=<br />            &lt;/CipherValue&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EncryptedKey&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/KeyInfo&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherValue&gt;Zbu2LQQeiHaUFXWPjLvPR9OLwrozCZj5i2zvcEFlx/<br />                     UICt2Cn0fTdy51dbHQRjTUXnOyx2PC5vptALXsvxrhPo5I+<br />                     I2SCr21rRUQ5H55P0ejJZMsAirkNjdhCe5RflVLdK96a6Sw0cz93inWi4rNkE1SiXB76cD08Y+DHrsjmGkW8/<br />                     TeHCK2f4xSykmdJGRwpxxdt2+3DxMjQPfg39Xkr4JjRlE6FvQ/R6hkEyyqLmCxUxbTV/<br />                     +mcBcwyE3AzrbOIl+627SG1fP4ovLmMkNvjlTl5lCZnoj6<br />        &lt;/CipherValue&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EncryptedData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;<br />...</pre></div></li>
    <li>Add the following Default.aspx Web page to your application's virtual directory, and then browse to this page to verify that encryption and decryption works correctly. <div><pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" %&gt;<br />&lt;script runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write("Clear text connection string is: " + <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["MyLocalSQLServer"].ConnectionString);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;body /&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>
      <p>Because your application must access the data using the same identity that you used to encrypt the data, you often need to run the encryption command using your application's service account identity. To do so, you can start a command Window by using the <strong>runas</strong> command as shown below specifying an appropriate domain and user name. </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Runas /profile /user:domain\user cmd</strong>
      </p>
      <p>When you run Aspnet_regiis from the resulting command window, it uses the specified identity to perform the encryption. This allows the application that uses the same identity to decrypt the data at run time. </p>
      <p>If your application runs under a different account than the one used to encrypt the data, ASP.NET will be unable to access the RSA user-level key container and will generate the following error: </p>
      <div>
        <pre>Parser Error Message: Failed to decrypt using provider 'RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider'. <br />Error message from the provider: Keyset does not exist  </pre>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>To change the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section back to clear text, run the following command from the .NET command prompt: <p><strong>aspnet_regiis -pd "connectionStrings" -app "/UserRSA"</strong></p><p>If the command is successful, you will see the following output: </p><div><pre>Decrypting configuration section...Succeeded!  </pre></div></li>

  <p>You can use RSA encryption in Web farms, because you can export RSA keys. You need to do this if you encrypt data in a Web.config file prior to deploying it to other servers in a Web farm. In this case, the private key required to decrypt the data must be exported and deployed to the other servers.</p>
  <h2>Using the RSA Provider to Encrypt a Connection String in Web.config in a Web Farm</h2>
  <p>To do this, you must create a custom RSA encryption key container and deploy the same key container on all servers in your Web farm. This won't work by default because the default RSA encryption key, <strong>"NetFrameworkConfigurationKey"</strong>, is different for each computer.</p>
  <h3>To use RSA encryption in a Web farm </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Run the following command from a command prompt to create a custom RSA encryption key: <p><strong>aspnet_regiis -pc "CustomKeys" -exp</strong></p><p>The <strong>-exp</strong> switch indicates that the keys are exportable. </p><p>If the command is successful, you will see the following output: </p><div><pre>Creating RSA Key container...Succeeded!  </pre></div><p>You can verify that a custom key container exists by looking for the file and checking timestamps in the following location: </p><p>\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA<br />\MachineKeys </p></li>
    <li>Create a new Web project named WebFarmRSA. Make sure that this directory is configured as a virtual directory. </li>
    <li>Add a Web.config configuration file to this directory. </li>
    <li>Add a sample <strong>connectionString</strong> similar to the following example: <div><pre>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;add name="MyLocalSQLServer" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connectionString="Initial Catalog=aspnetdb;data source=localhost;Integrated Security=SSPI;" <br />       providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" /&gt;<br />&lt;/connectionStrings&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>Add and configure a custom protected configuration provider. To do this, add the following &lt;<strong>configProtectedData</strong>&gt; section to the Web.config file. Note that the key container name is set to <strong>"CustomKeys"</strong>, which is the name of the key container created previously. <div><pre>...<br />&lt;configProtectedData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;providers&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;add keyContainerName="CustomKeys" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;useMachineContainer="true"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;description="Uses RsaCryptoServiceProvider to encrypt and decrypt"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;name="CustomProvider"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; type="System.Configuration.RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider,System.Configuration,<br />             Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/providers&gt;<br />&lt;/configProtectedData&gt;<br />...  </pre></div></li>
    <li>Run the following command from an SDK Command Prompt to encrypt the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section using the custom RSA key: <p><strong>aspnet_regiis -pe "connectionStrings" -app "/WebFarmRSA" -prov "CustomProvider"</strong></p><p>If the encryption is successful, you will see the following output: </p><div><pre>Encrypting configuration section...Succeeded!  </pre></div></li>
    <li>Review the Web.config file and examine the changes. The following elements are modified: <ul><li>&lt;<strong>EncryptedData</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>CipherData</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>CipherValue</strong>&gt; </li></ul><p>Your modified Web.Config file, with the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section encrypted, should be similar to the following example: </p><div><pre>...<br />  &lt;connectionStrings configProtectionProvider="CustomProvider"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptedData Type="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#Element"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;              xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptionMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#tripledes-cbc" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;KeyInfo xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptedKey xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptionMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#rsa-1_5" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;KeyInfo xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;KeyName&gt;Rsa Key&lt;/KeyName&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/KeyInfo&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherValue&gt;MWOaFwkByLRrvoGYeFUPMmN7e9uwC0D7gFEeyxs3Obll710dLQvD5XaMWcRxg1WwtOE9nysPQRrIJUaCm0b26LGUoa/<br />                         giGEfvWnslU2kig9SPICzsQAqUSB/inhRckWceb2xdy7TT+EI/vfsu6itJwE2AicMCTwx5I828mP8lV4=<br />            &lt;/CipherValue&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EncryptedKey&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/KeyInfo&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherValue&gt;IKO9jezdlJ/k1snyw5+e11cd9IVTlVfHBHSiYLgICf1EnMNd5WxVDZWP1uOW2UaY3Muv7HrSZCRbqq6hfA2uh2rxy5qAzFP+iu7Sg/<br />                     ku1Zvbwfq8p1UWHvPCukeyrBypiv0wpJ9Tuif7oP4Emgaoa+ewLnETSN411Gow28EKcLpbKWJDOC/<br />                     9o7g503YM4cnIvkQOomkYlL+MzMb3Rc1FSLiM9ncKQLZi+<br />                     JkRhlDIxFlsrFpKJhdNf5A0Sq2P71ZLI6G6QDCehHyn3kCZyBmVWJ0ueoGWXV4y<br />        &lt;/CipherValue&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EncryptedData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;<br />...</pre></div></li>
    <li>Run the following command from a .NET command prompt to export the custom RSA encryption key: <p><strong>aspnet_regiis -px "CustomKeys" "C:\CustomKeys.xml" -pri</strong></p><p>The <strong>-pri</strong> switch causes the private and public key to be exported. This enables both encryption and decryption. Without the-<strong>pri</strong> switch, you would only be able to encrypt data with the exported key. </p><p>If the command is successful, you will see the following output: </p><div><pre>Exporting RSA Keys to file...Succeeded!  </pre></div></li>
    <li>Deploy the application and the encrypted Web.config file on a different server computer. Also copy the CustomKeys.xml file to a local directory on the other server, for example to the C:\ directory. </li>
    <li>On the destination server, run the following command from a command prompt to import the custom RSA encryption keys: <p><strong>aspnet_regiis -pi "CustomKeys" "C:\CustomKeys.xml"</strong></p><p>If the command is successful, you will see the following output: </p><div><pre>Importing RSA Keys from file..Succeeded!  </pre></div><blockquote><strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After you have finished exporting and importing the RSA keys, it is important for security reasons to delete the CustomsKeys.xml file from both machines. </blockquote></li>
    <li>Grant access to the ASP.NET application identity. <p>The account used to run your Web application must be able to read the RSA key container. If you are not sure which identity your application uses, you can check this by adding the following code to a Web page: </p><div><pre>using System.Security.Principal;<br />...<br />protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write(WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent().Name);<br />}  </pre></div><p>By default, ASP.NET applications on Windows Server 2003 run using the NT Authority\Network Service account. The following command grants this account access to the CustomKeys store: </p><p><strong>aspnet_regiis -pa "CustomKeys" "NT Authority\Network Service"</strong></p><p>If the command runs successfully, you will see the following output. </p><div><pre>Adding ACL for access to the RSA Key container...Succeeded!  </pre></div><p>You can check the ACL of the file in the following folder: </p><div><pre>\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys  </pre></div><p>Your RSA key container file will be the one in this folder with the most recent timestamp. </p></li>
    <li>Add the following Default.aspx Web page to your application's virtual directory, and then browse to this page to verify that encryption and decryption work correctly. <div><pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" %&gt;<br />&lt;script runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write("Clear text connection string is: " + <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;       ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["MyLocalSQLServer"].ConnectionString);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;body/&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;  </pre></div></li>

  <p>This How to shows how you can use regular expressions within ASP.NET applications to constrain untrusted input. Regular expressions are a good way to validate text fields such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and other user information. You can use them to constrain input, apply formatting rules, and check lengths. To validate input captured with server controls, you can use the <strong>RegularExpressionValidator</strong> control. To validate other forms of input, such as query strings, cookies, and HTML control input, you can use the <strong>System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex</strong> class.</p>

    <li>Use regular expressions to constrain input, apply format rules, and check lengths. </li>
    <li>Use the ASP.NET <strong>RegularExpressionValidator</strong> control to constrain and validate input. </li>
    <li>Use the <strong>Regex</strong> class to constrain and validate input. </li>

  </ul>
  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>If you make unfounded assumptions about the type, length, format, or range of input, your application is unlikely to be robust. Input validation can become a security issue if an attacker discovers that you have made unfounded assumptions. The attacker can then supply carefully crafted input that compromises your application by attempting SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other injection attacks. To avoid such vulnerabilities, you should validate text fields (such as names, addresses, tax identification numbers, and so on) and use regular expressions to do the following: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Constrain the acceptable range of input characters. </li>
    <li>Apply formatting rules. For example, pattern-based fields, such as tax identification numbers, ZIP Codes, or postal codes, require specific patterns of input characters. </li>
    <li>Check lengths. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Regular expression support is available to ASP.NET applications through the <strong>RegularExpressionValidator</strong> control and the <strong>Regex</strong> class in the <strong>System.Text.RegularExpressions</strong> namespace.</p>
  <h1>Using a RegularExpressionValidator Control</h1>
  <p>If you capture input by using server controls, you can use the <strong>RegularExpressionValidator</strong> control to validate that input. You can use regular expressions to restrict the range of valid characters, to strip unwanted characters, and to perform length and format checks. You can constrain the input format by defining patterns that the input must match.</p>
  <h2>To validate a server control's input using a RegularExpressionValidator </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Add a <strong>RegularExpressionValidator</strong> control to your page. </li>
    <li>Set the <strong>ControlToValidate</strong> property to indicate which control to validate. </li>
    <li>Set the <strong>ValidationExpression</strong> property to an appropriate regular expression. </li>
    <li>Set the <strong>ErrorMessage</strong> property to define the message to display if the validation fails. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The following example shows a <strong>RegularExpressionValidator</strong> control used to validate a name field.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;%@ language="C#" %&gt;<br />&lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:TextBox ID="txtName" runat="server"/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:Button ID="btnSubmit" runat="server" Text="Submit" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:RegularExpressionValidator ID="regexpName" runat="server"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ErrorMessage="This expression does not validate." <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ControlToValidate="txtName"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ValidationExpression="^[a-zA-Z'.\s]{1,40}$" /&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>The regular expression used in the preceding code example constrains an input name field to alphabetic characters (lowercase and uppercase), space characters, the single quotation mark (or apostrophe) for names such as O'Dell, and the period or dot character. In addition, the field length is constrained to 40 characters.</p>
  <h2>Using ^ and $</h2>
  <p>Enclosing the expression in the caret (<strong>^</strong>) and dollar sign (<strong>$)</strong>markers ensures that the expression consists of the desired content and nothing else. A <strong>^</strong> matches the position at the beginning of the input string and a <strong>$</strong> matches the position at the end of the input string. If you omit these markers, an attacker could affix malicious input to the beginning or end of valid content and bypass your filter.</p>
  <h1>Using the Regex Class</h1>
  <p>If you are not using server controls (which means you cannot use the validation controls) or if you need to validate input from sources other than form fields, such as query string parameters or cookies, you can use the <strong>Regex</strong> class within the <strong>System.Text.RegularExpressions</strong> namespace.</p>
  <h2>To use the Regex class </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Add a <strong>using</strong> statement to reference the <strong>System.Text.RegularExpressions</strong> namespace. </li>
    <li>Call the <strong>IsMatch</strong> method of the <strong>Regex</strong> class, as shown in the following example. <div><pre>// Instance method:<br />Regex reg = new Regex(@"^[a-zA-Z'.]{1,40}$");<br />Response.Write(reg.IsMatch(txtName.Text));<br />// Static method:<br />if (!Regex.IsMatch(txtName.Text, <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; @"^[a-zA-Z'.]{1,40}$"))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; // Name does not match schema<br />}  </pre></div></li>
  </ol>
  <p>For performance reasons, you should use the static <strong>IsMatch</strong> method where possible to avoid unnecessary object creation.</p>
  <p>The following example shows how to use a regular expression to validate a name input through a regular client-side HTML control.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" %&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&lt;html&amp;nbsp; &gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;body&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form id="form1" method="post" action="HtmlControls.aspx"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Name:<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;input name="txtName" type="text" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;input name="submitBtn" type="Submit" value="Submit"/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
  </div>
  <pre>&lt;script runat="server"&gt;</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp; void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (Request.RequestType == "POST")<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; string name = Request.Form["txtName"];<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (name.Length &gt; 0)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch(name, <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "^[a-zA-Z'.]{1,40}$"))<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write("Valid name");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; else<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write("Invalid name");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp; }</pre>
  <pre>&lt;/script&gt;  </pre>
  <h2>Use Regular Expression Comments</h2>
  <p>Regular expressions are much easier to understand if you use the following syntax and comment each component of the expression by using a number sign (<strong>#</strong>). To enable comments, you must also specify <strong>RegexOptions.IgnorePatternWhitespace</strong>, which means that non-escaped white space is ignored.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>Regex regex = new Regex(@"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ^&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; # anchor at the start<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (?=.*\d)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; # must contain at least one numeric character<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (?=.*[a-z])&amp;nbsp; # must contain one lowercase character<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (?=.*[A-Z])&amp;nbsp; # must contain one uppercase character<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; .{8,10}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; # From 8 to 10 characters in length<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \s&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; # allows a space <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; $&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; # anchor at the end", <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; RegexOptions.IgnorePatternWhitespace);  </pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>This How to shows how you can validate input to protect your application from injection attacks. Performing input validation is essential because almost all application-level attacks contain malicious input. </p>
  <p>You should validate all input, including form fields, query string parameters, and cookies to protect your application against malicious command injection. Assume all input to your Web application is malicious, and make sure that you use server validation for all sources of input. Use client-side validation to reduce round trips to the server and to improve the user experience, but do not rely on it because it is easily bypassed. </p>
  <p>To validate input, define acceptable input for each application input field. A proven practice is to constrain input for length, range, format, and type. Use the list of acceptable characters to define valid input, instead of the list of unacceptable characters. Using the list of unacceptable characters is impractical because it is very difficult to anticipate all possible variations of bad input.</p>
  <p>When you need to accept a range of HTML characters, make sure that you HTML-encode the data to make it safe prior to displaying it as output.</p>

  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>You need to validate all untrusted input to your application. You should assume that any input from users is malicious. User input to your Web application includes form fields, query strings, client-side cookies, and browser environment values such as user agent strings and IP addresses. </p>
  <p>Weak input validation is a common vulnerability that could allow your application to be exploited by a number of injection attacks. The following are common types of attacks that exploit weak or missing input validation: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>SQL injection. </strong>If you generate dynamic SQL queries based on user input, an attacker could inject malicious SQL commands that can be executed by the database. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-site scripting.</strong> Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in Web page validation by injecting client-side script code. This code is subsequently sent to an unsuspecting user's computer and executed on the browser. Because the browser downloads the script code from a trusted site, the browser has no way of determining whether the code is legitimate. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Unauthorized file access.</strong> If your code accepts input from a caller, a malicious user could potentially manipulate your code's file operations, such as accessing a file they should not access or exploiting your code by injecting bad data. </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Injection attacks work over HTTP and HTTPS Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connections. Encryption provides no defense.</blockquote>
  <p>The general approach for input validation is summarized here. You should apply this approach to any input that comes from the network, such as text boxes and other forms field input, query string parameters, cookies, server variables, and Web method parameters. Note that the strategy is to first allow only good input and then deny bad input. This is because you can easily define good input for your application, but you cannot realistically anticipate the format for all malicious input. </p>
  <p>Check for valid input as follows: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Constrain: </strong>Check for known good data by validating the type, length, format, and range. To constrain input from server controls, use the ASP.NET validator controls. To constrain input from other sources, use regular expressions and custom validation. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reject:</strong> Check for any known bad data and reject bad input. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sanitize:</strong> Sometimes you also need to sanitize input and make potentially malicious input safe. For example, if your application supports free-format input fields, such as comment fields, you might want to permit certain safe HTML elements, such as &lt;<strong>b</strong>&gt; and &lt;<strong>i</strong>&gt;, and eliminate any other HTML elements. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Summary of Steps</h1>
  <p>To protect your ASP.NET application from injection attacks, perform the following steps: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step 1. Use ASP.NET request validation. </li>
    <li>Step 2. Constrain input. </li>
    <li>Step 3. Encode unsafe output. </li>
    <li>Step 4. Use command parameters for SQL queries. </li>
    <li>Step 5. Verify that ASP.NET errors are not returned to the client. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The next sections describe each of these.</p>
  <h1>Step 1. Use ASP.NET Request Validation</h1>
  <p>By default, ASP.NET request validation detects any HTML elements and reserved characters in data posted to the server. This helps prevent users from inserting scripts into your application. Request validation checks all input data against a hard-coded list of potentially dangerous values. If a match occurs, it throws an exception of type <strong>HttpRequestValidationException</strong>.</p>
  <p>You can disable request validation in your Web.config application configuration file by adding a &lt;<strong>pages</strong>&gt; element with <strong>validateRequest="false"</strong> or on an individual page by setting <strong>ValidateRequest="false"</strong> on the <strong>@ Pages</strong> element. </p>
  <p>If you need to disable request validation, you should disable it only on the affected page. An example of this is when you have a page with a free-format text field that accepts HTML-formatted input.</p>
  <h2>Confirm that ASP.NET Request Validation Is Enabled in Machine.config</h2>
  <p>Request validation is enabled by ASP.NET by default. You can see the following default setting in the Machine.config.comments file.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;pages validateRequest="true" ... /&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>Confirm that you have not disabled request validation by overriding the default settings in your server's Machine.config file or your application's Web.config file. </p>
  <h2>Test ASP.NET Request Validation</h2>
  <p>You can test the effects of request validation. To do this, create an ASP.NET page that disables request validation by setting <strong>ValidateRequest="false"</strong>, as follows.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;%@ Language="C#" ValidateRequest="false" %&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;script runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; void btnSubmit_Click(Object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // If ValidateRequest is false, then 'hello' is displayed<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // If ValidateRequest is true, then ASP.NET returns an exception<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write(txtString.Text);<br />&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:TextBox id="txtString" runat="server" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Text="&lt;script&gt;alert('hello');&lt;/script&gt;" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:Button id="btnSubmit" runat="server" OnClick="btnSubmit_Click" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Text="Submit" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>When you run the page, "Hello" is displayed in a message box because the script in <strong>txtString</strong> is passed through and rendered as client-side script in your browser.</p>
  <p>If you set <strong>ValidateRequest="true" </strong>or remove the <strong>ValidateRequest</strong> page attribute, ASP.NET request validation rejects the script input and produces an error similar to the following.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>A potentially dangerous Request.Form value was detected from the client (txtString="&lt;script&gt;alert('hello...").  </pre>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Do not rely on ASP.NET request validation. Treat it as an extra precautionary measure in addition to your own input validation.</blockquote>
  <h1>Step 2. Constrain Input</h1>
  <p>To constrain input, follow these guidelines: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Use server-side input validation.</strong> Do not rely on client-side validation because it is easily bypassed. Use client-side validation in addition to server-side validation to reduce round trips to the server and to improve the user experience. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Validate length, range, format and type.</strong> Make sure that any input meets your guidelines for known good input. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use strong data typing. </strong>Assign numeric values to numeric data types such as <strong>Integer</strong> or <strong>Double</strong>. Assign string values to string data types. Assign dates to the <strong>DateTime</strong> data type. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For Web form applications that obtain input through server controls, use the ASP.NET validator controls to constrain the input. For other sources of input data, such as query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers, constrain input by using the <strong>Regex</strong> class from the <strong>System.Text.RegularExpressions</strong> namespace.</p>
  <h2>Explicitly Check Input from Form Fields</h2>
  <p>To constrain form field input received through server controls, you can use the following ASP.NET validator controls: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>RegularExpressionValidator.</strong> Use this control to constrain text input. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>RangeValidator.</strong> Use this control to check the ranges of numeric, currency, date, and string input. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CustomValidator.</strong> Use this control for custom validation, such as ensuring that a date is in the future or in the past. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>To validate form field input received through HTML input controls, perform validation in server-side code and use the <strong>Regex</strong> class to help constrain text input. The following sections describe how to constrain a variety of common input types.</p>
  <h3>Validating Text Fields </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>To validate text fields, such as names, addresses, and tax identification numbers, use regular expressions to do the following: </li>
    <li>Constrain the acceptable range of input characters. </li>
    <li>Apply formatting rules. For example, pattern-based fields, such as tax identification numbers, ZIP Codes, or postal codes, require specific patterns of input characters. </li>
    <li>Check lengths. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Using a RegularExpressionValidator</h3>
  <p>To use a <strong>RegularExpressionValidator</strong>, set the <strong>ControlToValidate</strong>, <strong>ValidationExpression</strong>, and <strong>ErrorMessage </strong>properties to appropriate values as shown in the following example.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;form id="WebForm" method="post" runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:TextBox id="txtName" runat="server"&gt;&lt;/asp:TextBox&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:RegularExpressionValidator id="nameRegex" runat="server" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ControlToValidate="txtName" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ValidationExpression="^[a-zA-Z'.\s]{1,40}$" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ErrorMessage="Invalid name"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/asp:regularexpressionvalidator&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>The regular expression used in the preceding code example limits an input name field to alphabetic characters (lowercase and uppercase), space characters, the single apostrophe for names such as O'Dell, and the period. In addition, the field length is constrained to 40 characters.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The <strong>RegularExpressionValidator</strong> control automatically adds a caret (^) and dollar sign ($) as delimiters to the beginning and end of expressions if you have not added them yourself. You should add them to all of your regular expressions as a good practice.&amp;nbsp; Enclosing the expression in the delimiters ensures that the expression consists of the desired content and nothing else.</blockquote>
  <h3>Using the Regex Class</h3>
  <p>If you are not using server controls (which means you cannot use the validator controls), or you need to validate input from sources other than form fields (such as from query string parameters or cookies), you can use a <strong>Regex</strong> class.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>To use the Regex class</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Add a <strong>using</strong> statement to reference the<strong> System.Text.RegularExpressions</strong> namespace. </li>
    <li>Ensure that the regular expression is contained in the ^ and $ anchor characters (beginning of string, end of string). </li>
    <li>Call the <strong>IsMatch</strong> method of the <strong>Regex</strong> class, as shown in the following code example. </li>
  </ol>
  <div>
    <pre>// Instance method:<br />Regex reg = new Regex(@"^[a-zA-Z'.\s]{1,40}$");<br />Response.Write(reg.IsMatch(txtName.Text));</pre>
  </div>
  <pre>// Static method:<br />if (!Regex.IsMatch(txtName.Text,@"^[a-zA-Z'.\s]{1,40}$")) <br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; // Name does not match expression<br />}</pre>
  <p>If you cannot cache your regular expression for frequent use, you should use the static <strong>IsMatch</strong> method where possible for performance reasons, to avoid unnecessary object creation.</p>
  <h3>Validating Numeric Fields</h3>
  <p>In most cases, numeric fields should be checked for type and range. To validate the type and range of a numeric input field that uses a server control, you can use a <strong>RangeValidator</strong> control. The <strong>RangeValidator</strong> supports currency, date, integer, double, and string data types. </p>
  <p>To use a <strong>RangeValidator</strong>, set the <strong>ControlToValidate</strong>, <strong>Type</strong>, <strong>MinimumValue</strong>, <strong>MaximumValue</strong>, and <strong>ErrorMessage</strong> properties to appropriate values as shown in the following example.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;asp:RangeValidator <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ID="RangeValidator1" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Runat="server" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ErrorMessage="Invalid range. Number must be between 0 and 255."<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ControlToValidate="rangeInput" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MaximumValue="255" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MinimumValue="0" Type="Integer" /&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>If you are not using a server control, you can validate a numeric range by converting the input value to an integer and then performing a range check. For example, to validate that an integer is valid, convert the input value to a variable of type <strong>System.Int32</strong> by using the <strong>Int32.TryParse</strong> method. This method returns <strong>false</strong> if the type conversion fails.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>Int32 i;<br />if (Int32.TryParse(txtInput.Text, out i) == false)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; // Conversion failed<br />}  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>The following code shows how to perform a type and range check for an integer entered through an HTML text input control. </p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" %&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&lt;script runat="server"&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&amp;nbsp; void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (Request.RequestType == "POST")<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; int i;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (Int32.TryParse(Request.Form["integerTxt"], out i) == true)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // TryParse returns true if the conversion succeeds<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if ((0 &lt;= i &amp;&amp; i &lt;= 255) == true)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write("Input data is valid.");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; else<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write("Input data is out of range");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; else<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write("Input data is not an integer");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
  </div>
  <pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;body&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form id="form1" action="NumericInput.aspx" method="post"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Enter an integer between 0 and 255:<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;input name="integerTxt" type="text" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;input name="Submit" type="submit" value="submit" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
  <h3>Validating Date Fields</h3>
  <p>You need to validate that date fields are of the correct type. In most cases, you also need to check them for range, for example to validate that they are in the future or past. If you use a server control to capture an input date, and if you also need to validate that a date falls within a specific range, you can use a <strong>RangeValidator</strong> control with its <strong>Type</strong> field set to <strong>Date</strong>. This control lets you specify a range by using constant date values. If you need to validate a date range based on today's date, for example to validate that a date is in the future or the past, you can use a <strong>CustomValidator</strong> control.</p>
  <p>To use a <strong>CustomValidator</strong> control to validate a date, set the <strong>ControlToValidate</strong> and <strong>ErrorMessage</strong> properties and the <strong>OnServerValidate</strong> event to point to a custom method containing your validation logic. The following sample .aspx page code shows this approach.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" %&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&lt;script runat="server"&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&amp;nbsp;void ValidateDateInFuture(object source, ServerValidateEventArgs args)<br />&amp;nbsp;{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; DateTime dt;</pre>
  </div>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Check for valid date and that the date is in the future<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if ((DateTime.TryParse(args.Value, out dt) == false) || <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (dt &lt;= DateTime.Today))<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; args.IsValid = false;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;}&amp;nbsp;</pre>
  <pre>&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
  <pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;body&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:Label ID="Label1" Runat="server" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Text="Future Date:"&gt;&lt;/asp:Label&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:TextBox ID="futureDatetxt" Runat="server"&gt;&lt;/asp:TextBox&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:CustomValidator <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ID="CustomValidator1" Runat="server" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ErrorMessage="Invalid date. Enter a date in the future."<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ControlToValidate="futureDatetxt"&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; OnServerValidate="ValidateDateInFuture"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/asp:CustomValidator&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:Button ID="submitBtn" Runat="server" Text="Submit"&amp;nbsp; /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;<br /></pre>

    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The preceding code uses <strong>DateTime.TryParse</strong>, which is new to .NET Framework 2.0.</blockquote>
  <h2>Sanitizing Free-Text Fields</h2>
  <p>To <em>sanitize</em> input, you make untrusted input safe by preventing it from being treated as code. For example, if your application handles user input that it cannot constrain or reads data from a shared database, you might need to sanitize the data or make the output safe when you write it on your page. Sanitize data prior to output by using <strong>AntiXSSLibrary.HtmlEncode</strong>. </p>
  <h2>Allowing Restricted HTML Input</h2>
  <p>If your application needs to accept a range of HTML elements—for example through a rich text input field such as a comments field—turn off ASP.NET request validation and create a filter that allows only the HTML elements that you want your application to accept. A common practice is to restrict formatting to safe HTML elements such as &lt;<strong>b</strong>&gt; (bold) and &lt;<strong>i</strong>&gt; (italic). Before writing the data, HTML-encode it. This makes any malicious script safe by causing it to be handled as text, not as executable code. </p>
  <h2>To allow restricted HTML input </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Disable ASP.NET request validation by the adding the <strong>ValidateRequest="false"</strong> attribute to the <strong>@ Page</strong> directive. </li>
    <li>Encode the string input with the <strong>HtmlEncode</strong> method. </li>
    <li>Use a <strong>StringBuilder</strong> and call its Replace method to selectively remove the encoding on the HTML elements that you want to permit. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The following .aspx page code shows this approach. The page disables ASP.NET request validation by setting <strong>ValidateRequest="false"</strong>. It HTML-encodes the input and selectively allows the &lt;<strong>b</strong>&gt; and &lt;<strong>i</strong>&gt; HTML elements to support simple text formatting. </p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" ValidateRequest="false"%&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&lt;script runat="server"&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&amp;nbsp; void submitBtn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Encode the string input<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; AntiXSSLibrary.HtmlEncode(htmlInputTxt.Text));<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Selectively allow&amp;nbsp; and &lt;i&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sb.Replace("&lt;b&gt;", "&lt;b&gt;");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sb.Replace("&lt;/b&gt;", "");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sb.Replace("&lt;i&gt;", "&lt;i&gt;");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sb.Replace("&lt;/i&gt;", "");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write(sb.ToString());<br />&amp;nbsp; }<br />&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;body&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:TextBox ID="htmlInputTxt" Runat="server" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; TextMode="MultiLine" Width="318px"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Height="168px"&gt;&lt;/asp:TextBox&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:Button ID="submitBtn" Runat="server" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Text="Submit" OnClick="submitBtn_Click" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <h2>Validate Query String Values</h2>
  <p>Validate query string values for length, range, format, and type. You usually do this by using a combination of regular expressions to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Constrain the input values. </li>
    <li>Set explicit range checks. </li>
    <li>Specify the explicit type checks performed by converting the input value to its equivalent .NET Framework type and handling any ensuing conversion errors. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following code example shows how to use the <strong>Regex</strong> class to validate a name string passed on a query string. </p>
  <div>
    <pre>void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; if (!System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Request.QueryString["Name"], @"^[a-zA-Z'.\s]{1,40}$"))<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write("Invalid name parameter");<br />&amp;nbsp; else<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write("Name is " + Request.QueryString["Name"]);<br />}  </pre>
  </div>
  <h2>Validate Cookie Values</h2>
  <p>Values maintained in cookies, such as query string parameters, can easily be manipulated by a client. Validate cookie values in the same way as you would for query string parameters. Validate them for length, range, format, and type.</p>
  <h2>Validate File and URL Paths</h2>
  <p>If your application has to accept input file names, file paths, or URL paths, you need to validate that the path is in the correct format and that it points to a valid location within the context of your application. Failure to do this can result in attackers persuading your application into accessing arbitrary files and resources. </p>
  <h3>Validating File Paths</h3>
  <p>To prevent a malicious user manipulating your code's file operations, avoid writing code that accepts user-supplied file or path input. For example: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you must accept file names as input, use the full name of the file by using <strong>System.IO.Path.GetFileName</strong>. </li>
    <li>If you must accept file paths as input, use the full file path by using <strong>System.IO.Path.GetFullPath</strong>. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Using MapPath to Prevent Cross Application Mapping</h3>
  <p>If you use <strong>MapPath</strong> to map a supplied virtual path to a physical path on the server, use the overload of <strong>Request.MapPath</strong> that accepts a <strong>bool</strong> parameter so that you can prevent cross-application mapping. The following code example shows this technique.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>try<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; string mappedPath = Request.MapPath( inputPath.Text, <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Request.ApplicationPath, false);<br />}<br />catch (HttpException)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; // Cross-application mapping attempted<br />}  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>The final <strong>false</strong> parameter prevents cross-application mapping. This means that a user cannot successfully supply a path that contains <strong>".."</strong> to traverse outside of your application's virtual directory hierarchy. Any attempt to do this results in an exception of type <strong>HttpException</strong>.</p>
  <p>If you use server controls, you can use the <strong>Control.MapPathSecure</strong> method to retrieve the physical path to which the virtual path is mapped. <strong>Control.MapPathSecure</strong> uses code access security and throws an <strong>HttpException</strong> if the server control does not have permissions to read the resulting mapped file. For more information, see <strong>Control.MapPathSecure</strong> in the .NET Framework SDK documentation.</p>
  <h3>Using Code Access Security to Restrict File I/O</h3>
  <p>An administrator can restrict an application's file I/O to its own virtual directory hierarchy by configuring the application to run with Medium trust. In this event, .NET code access security ensures that no file access is permitted outside of the application's virtual directory hierarchy.</p>
  <p>You configure an application to run with Medium trust by setting the &lt;<strong>trust</strong>&gt; element in Web.config or Machine.config.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;trust level="Medium" /&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <h3>Validating URLs</h3>
  <p>You can filter for a valid URL format using a regular expression, such as the following.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>^(?:http|https|ftp)://[a-zA-Z0-9\.\-]+(?:\:\d{1,5})?(?:[A-Za-z0-9\.\;\:\@\&amp;\=\+\$\,\?/]|%u[0-9A-Fa-f]{4}|%[0-9A-Fa-f]{2})*$  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>This constrains the input, but it does not validate whether the URL is valid in terms of the application boundaries. You should check whether the target is valid in the context of your application. For example, does it point to an authorized server that you expect your application to communicate with?</p>
  <h1>Step 3. Encode Unsafe Output</h1>
  <p>If you write text output to a Web page, encode it using <strong>AntiXSSLibrary.HtmlEncode</strong>. Do this if the text came from user input, a database, or a local file. </p>
  <p>Similarly, if you write URLs that might contain unsafe characters because they have been constructed from input data or data from a shared database, use <strong>AntiXSSLibrary.UrlEncode</strong> to make them safe. </p>
  <p>Avoid the mistake of encoding the data early. Make sure you encode at the last possible opportunity before the data is displayed to the client. </p>
  <p>Do not use the <strong>HttpUtilty </strong>class provided by ASP.NET as it does not do a complete job of protecting against cross site scripting attacks, the <strong>AntiXSSLibrary </strong>is much more effective.</p>
  <h2>Use HtmlEncode to Encode Unsafe Output</h2>
  <p>The <strong>HtmlEncode</strong> method replaces characters that have special meaning in HTML to HTML variables that represent those characters. For example, &lt; is replaced with <strong>&lt;</strong> and <strong>"</strong> is replaced with <strong>"</strong>. Encoded data does not cause the browser to execute code. Instead, the data is rendered as harmless text, and the tags are not interpreted as HTML.</p>
  <p>To illustrate the use of <strong>HtmlEncode</strong>, the following page accepts input from the user and allows potentially unsafe HTML characters by setting <strong>ValidateRequest="false"</strong>. Before writing the input back to the user, the code calls <strong>AntiXSSLibrary.HtmlEncode</strong> on the supplied input text. This renders any potentially unsafe HTML as harmless text. </p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" ValidateRequest="false" %&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&lt;script runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; void submitBtn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write(AntiXSSLibrary.HtmlEncode(inputTxt.Text));<br />&amp;nbsp; }<br />&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&lt;html&amp;nbsp; &gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;body&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:TextBox ID="inputTxt" Runat="server" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; TextMode="MultiLine" Width="382px" Height="152px"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/asp:TextBox&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:Button ID="submitBtn" Runat="server" Text="Submit" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; OnClick="submitBtn_Click" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>To see the effect of the HTML encoding, place the preceding page in a virtual directory, browse to it, enter some HTML code in the input text box, and click <strong>Submit</strong>. For example, the following input is rendered as text.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>Run script and say hello &lt;script&gt;alert('hello');&lt;/script&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>It produces the following safe output.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>Run script and say hello &lt;script&gt;alert('hello');&lt;/script&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>If you remove the call to <strong>HtmlEncode</strong> and simply write back the input, the browser executes the script and displays a message box. Malicious script could pose a significant threat. </p>
  <h2>Use UrlEncode to Encode Unsafe URLs</h2>
  <p>If you need to write URLs that are based on input that you do not fully trust, use <strong>AntiXSSLibrary.UrlEncode</strong> to encode the URL string.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>AntiXSSLibrary.UrlEncode( urlString );  </pre>
  </div>
  <h1>Step 4. Use Command Parameters for SQL Queries</h1>
  <p>To help prevent SQL injection, use command parameters for SQL queries. The <strong>Parameters</strong> collection provides type checking and length validation. If you use the <strong>Parameters</strong> collection, input is treated as a literal value and SQL does not treat it as executable code. An additional benefit of using the <strong>Parameters</strong> collection is that you can enforce type and length checks. Values outside of the range trigger an exception.</p>
  <h2>Use Parameters Collection When You Call a Stored Procedure</h2>
  <p>The following code fragment illustrates the use of the <strong>Parameters</strong> collection when calling a stored procedure.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>SqlDataAdapter myCommand = new SqlDataAdapter("AuthorLogin", <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; myConnection);<br />myCommand.SelectCommand.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;<br />SqlParameter parm = myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "@LoginId", SqlDbType.VarChar, 11);<br />parm.Value = Login.Text;  </pre>
  </div>
  <h2>Use Parameters Collection When Building Your SQL Statements</h2>
  <p>If you cannot use stored procedures, you can still use parameters, as shown in the following code fragment.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>SqlDataAdapter myCommand = new SqlDataAdapter(<br />"SELECT au_lname, au_fname FROM Authors WHERE au_id = @au_id", myConnection);<br />SQLParameter parm = myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "@au_id" ,SqlDbType.VarChar, 11);<br />Parm.Value = Login.Text;  </pre>
  </div>
  <h1>Step 5. Verify that ASP.NET Errors Are Not Returned to the Client</h1>
  <p>You can use the &lt;<strong>customErrors</strong>&gt; element to configure custom, generic error messages that should be returned to the client in the event of an application exception condition.</p>
  <p>Make sure that the <strong>mode</strong> attribute is set to <strong>"remoteOnly"</strong> in the web.config file as shown in the following example.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;customErrors mode="remoteOnly" /&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>After installing an ASP.NET application, you can configure the setting to point to your custom error page as shown in the following example.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="YourErrorPage.htm" /&gt;  </pre>
  </div>

  <p>This How to shows how you can help protect your ASP.NET applications from cross-site scripting attacks by using proper input validation techniques and by encoding the output. It also describes a number of other protection mechanisms that you can use in addition to these two main countermeasures.</p>
  <p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in Web page validation by injecting client-side script code. Common vulnerabilities that make your Web applications susceptible to cross-site scripting attacks include failing to properly validate input, failing to encode output, and trusting the data retrieved from a shared database. To protect your application against cross-site scripting attacks, assume that all input is malicious. Constrain and validate all input. Encode all output that could, potentially, include HTML characters. This includes data read from files and databases.</p>

    <li>Understand the common cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in Web page validation. </li>
    <li>Apply countermeasures for cross-site scripting attacks. </li>
    <li>Constrain input by using regular expressions, type checks, and ASP.NET validator controls. </li>

  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>Cross-site scripting attacks exploit vulnerabilities in Web page validation by injecting client-side script code. The script code embeds itself in response data, which is sent back to an unsuspecting user. The user's browser then runs the script code. Because the browser downloads the script code from a trusted site, the browser has no way of recognizing that the code is not legitimate, and Microsoft Internet Explorer security zones provide no defense. Cross-site scripting attacks work over HTTP and HTTPS (SSL) connections.&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <p>One of the most serious examples of a cross-site scripting attack occurs when an attacker writes script to retrieve the authentication cookie that provides access to a trusted site and then posts the cookie to a Web address known to the attacker. This enables the attacker to spoof the legitimate user's identity and gain illicit access to the Web site.</p>
  <p>Common vulnerabilities that make your Web application susceptible to cross-site scripting attacks include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Failing to constrain and validate input. </li>
    <li>Failing to encode output. </li>
    <li>Trusting data retrieved from a shared database. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Guidelines</h2>
  <p>The two most important countermeasures to prevent cross-site scripting attacks are to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Constrain input</strong>.<strong></strong></li>
    <li>
      <strong>Encode output</strong>. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Constrain Input</h3>
  <p>Start by assuming that all input is malicious. Validate input type, length, format, and range. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To constrain input supplied through server controls, use ASP.NET validator controls such as <strong>RegularExpressionValidator</strong> and <strong>RangeValidator</strong>. </li>
    <li>To constrain input supplied through client-side HTML input controls or input from other sources such as query strings or cookies, use the <strong>System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex</strong> class in your server-side code to check for expected using regular expressions. </li>
    <li>To validate types such as integers, doubles, dates, and currency amounts, convert the input data to the equivalent .NET Framework data type and handle any resulting conversion errors. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Encode Output</h3>
  <p>Use the <strong>AntiXSSLibrary.HtmlEncode</strong> method to encode output if it contains input from the user or from other sources such as databases. <strong>HtmlEncode</strong> replaces characters that have special meaning in HTML-to-HTML variables that represent those characters. For example, &lt; is replaced with <strong>&lt;</strong> and <strong>"</strong> is replaced with <strong>"</strong>. Encoded data does not cause the browser to execute code. Instead, the data is rendered as harmless HTML.</p>
  <p>Similarly, use <strong>AntiXSSLibrary.UrlEncode</strong> to encode output URLs if they are constructed from input.</p>
  <h1>Summary of Steps</h1>
  <p>To prevent cross-site scripting, perform the following steps: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step 1. Check that ASP.NET request validation is enabled. </li>
    <li>Step 2. Review ASP.NET code that generates HTML output. </li>
    <li>Step 3. Determine whether HTML output includes input parameters. </li>
    <li>Step 4. Review potentially dangerous HTML tags and attributes. </li>
    <li>Step 5. Evaluate countermeasures. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Step 1. Check That ASP.NET Request Validation Is Enabled</h1>
  <p>By default, request validation is enabled in Machine.config. Verify that request validation is currently enabled in your server's Machine.config file and that your application does not override this setting in its Web.config file. Check that <strong>validateRequest</strong> is set to <strong>true </strong>as shown in the following code example.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;system.web&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;pages buffer="true" validateRequest="true" /&gt;<br />&lt;/system.web&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>You can disable request validation on a page-by-page basis. Check that your pages do not disable this feature unless necessary. For example, you may need to disable this feature for a page if it contains a free-format, rich-text entry field designed to accept a range of HTML characters as input. </p>
  <h2>To test that ASP.NET request validation is enabled </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Create an ASP.NET page that disables request validation. To do this, set <strong>ValidateRequest="false"</strong>, as shown in the following code example. <div><pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" ValidateRequest="false" %&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;script runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; void btnSubmit_Click(Object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // If ValidateRequest is false, then 'hello' is displayed<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // If ValidateRequest is true, then ASP.NET returns an exception<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write(txtString.Text);<br />&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:TextBox id="txtString" runat="server" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Text="&lt;script&gt;alert('hello');&lt;/script&gt;" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:Button id="btnSubmit" runat="server"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; OnClick="btnSubmit_Click" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Text="Submit" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>Run the page. It displays <strong>Hello</strong> in a message box&amp;nbsp;because the script in txtString is passed through and rendered as a client-side script in your browser.&amp;nbsp;</li>
    <li>Set <strong>ValidateRequest="true"</strong> or remove the <strong>ValidateRequest</strong> page attribute and browse to the page again. Verify that the following error message is displayed. <div><pre>A potentially dangerous Request.Form value was detected from the client (txtString="&lt;script&gt;alert('hello...").  </pre></div><p>This indicates that ASP.NET request validation is active and has rejected the input because it includes potentially dangerous HTML characters. </p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Do not rely on ASP.NET request validation. Treat it as an extra precautionary measure in addition to your own input validation.</blockquote></li>
  </ol>
  <h1>
    <br />Step 2. Review ASP.NET Code That Generates HTML Output</h1>
  <p>ASP.NET writes HTML as output in two ways, as shown in the following code examples.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>Response.Write<br />&lt;% = </pre>
  </div>
  <p>Search your pages to locate where HTML and URL output is returned to the client.</p>
  <h1>Step 3. Determine Whether HTML Output Includes Input Parameters</h1>
  <p>Analyze your design and your page code to determine whether the output includes any input parameters. These parameters can come from a variety of sources. The following list includes common input sources: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Form fields</strong>, such as the following. <div><pre>Response.Write(name.Text);<br />Response.Write(Request.Form["name"]);<br />Query Strings<br />Response.Write(Request.QueryString["name"]);  </pre></div></li>
    <li>
      <strong>Query strings</strong>, such as the following: <div><pre>Response.Write(Request.QueryString["username"]);  </pre></div></li>
    <li>
      <strong>Databases and data access methods</strong>, such as the following: <div><pre>SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();<br />Response.Write(reader.GetString(1));  </pre></div><p>Be particularly careful with data read from a database if it is shared by other applications. </p></li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cookie collection</strong>, such as the following: <div><pre>Response.Write(<br />Request.Cookies["name"].Values["name"]);  </pre></div></li>
    <li>
      <strong>Session and application variables</strong>, such as the following: <div><pre>Response.Write(Session["name"]);<br />Response.Write(Application["name"]);  </pre></div></li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to source code analysis, you can also perform a simple test by typing text such as "<strong>XYZ</strong>" in form fields and testing the output. If the browser displays "<strong>XYZ</strong>" or if you see "<strong>XYZ</strong>" when you view the source of the HTML, your Web application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. </p>
  <p>To see something more dynamic, inject &lt;<strong>script</strong>&gt;<strong>alert('hello');</strong>&lt;<strong>/script</strong>&gt; through an input field. This technique might not work in all cases because it depends on how the input is used to generate the output.</p>
  <h1>Step 4. Review Potentially Dangerous HTML Tags and Attributes</h1>
  <p>If you dynamically create HTML tags and construct tag attributes with potentially unsafe input, make sure you HTML-encode the tag attributes before writing them out. </p>
  <p>The following .aspx page shows how you can write HTML directly to the return page by using the &lt;<strong>asp:Literal</strong>&gt; control. The code takes user input of a color name, inserts it into the HTML sent back, and displays text in the color entered. The page uses <strong>HtmlEncode</strong> to ensure the inserted text is safe.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true"%&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Color:&amp;nbsp;&lt;asp:TextBox ID="TextBox1" runat="server"&gt;&lt;/asp:TextBox&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:Button ID="Button1" runat="server" Text="Show color" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; OnClick="Button1_Click" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:Literal ID="Literal1" runat="server"&gt;&lt;/asp:Literal&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
  </div>
  <pre>&lt;script runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; private void Page_Load(Object Src, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Literal1.Text = @"&lt;span style=""color:" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; + Server.HtmlEncode(TextBox1.Text)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; + @"""&gt;Color example&lt;/span&gt;";<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp; }<br />&lt;/Script&gt;</pre>
  <h2>Potentially Dangerous HTML Tags</h2>
  <p>While not an exhaustive list, the following commonly used HTML tags could allow a malicious user to inject script code: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>&lt;<strong>applet</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>body</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>embed</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>frame</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>script</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>frameset</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>html</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>iframe</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>img</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>style</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>layer</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>link</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>ilayer</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>meta</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>object</strong>&gt; </li>
  </ul>
  <p>An attacker can use HTML attributes such as <strong>src</strong>, <strong>lowsrc</strong>, <strong>style</strong>, and <strong>href</strong> in conjunction with the preceding tags to inject cross-site scripting. For example, the <strong>src</strong> attribute of the &lt;<strong>img</strong>&gt; tag can be a source of injection, as shown in the following examples.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;img src="javascript:alert('hello');"&gt;<br />&lt;img src="java
script:alert('hello');"&gt;<br />&lt;img src="java
script:alert('hello');"&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>An attacker can also use the &lt;<strong>style</strong>&gt; tag to inject a script by changing the MIME type as shown in the following.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;style TYPE="text/javascript"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; alert('hello');<br />&lt;/style&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <h1>Step 5. Evaluate Countermeasures</h1>
  <p>When you find ASP.NET code that generates HTML using some input, you need to evaluate appropriate countermeasures for your specific application. Countermeasures include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encode HTML output. </li>
    <li>Encode URL output. </li>
    <li>Filter user input. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Encode HTML Output</h2>
  <p>If you write text output to a Web page and you do not know if the text contains HTML special characters (such as &lt;, &gt;, and <strong>&amp;</strong>), pre-process the text by using the <strong>AntiXSSLibrary.HtmlEncode</strong> method as shown in the following code example. Do this if the text came from user input, a database, or a local file.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>Response.Write(AntiXSSLibrary.HtmlEncode(Request.Form["name"]));  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>Do not substitute encoding output for checking that input is well-formed and correct. Use it as an additional security precaution.</p>
  <h2>Encode URL Output</h2>
  <p>If you return URL strings that contain input to the client, use the <strong>AntiXSSLibrary.UrlEncode</strong> method to encode these URL strings as shown in the following code example.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>Response.Write(AntiXSSLibrary.UrlEncode(urlString));  </pre>
  </div>
  <h2>Filter User Input</h2>
  <p>If you have pages that need to accept a range of HTML elements, for example through some kind of rich text input field, you must disable ASP.NET request validation for the page. If you have several pages that do this, create a filter that allows only the HTML elements that you want to accept. A common practice is to restrict formatting to safe HTML elements such as bold (&lt;<strong>b</strong>&gt;) and italic (&lt;<strong>i</strong>&gt;).</p>
  <h3>To safely allow restricted HTML input </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Disable ASP.NET request validation by the adding the <strong>ValidateRequest="false"</strong> attribute to the <strong>@ Page</strong> directive. </li>
    <li>Encode the string input with the <strong>HtmlEncode</strong> method. </li>
    <li>Use a <strong>StringBuilder</strong> and call its <strong>Replace</strong> method to selectively remove the encoding on the HTML elements that you want to permit. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The following .aspx page code shows this approach. The page disables ASP.NET request validation by setting <strong>ValidateRequest="false"</strong>. It HTML-encodes the input and then selectively allows the &lt;<strong>b</strong>&gt; and &lt;<strong>i</strong>&gt; HTML elements to support simple text formatting. </p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" ValidateRequest="false"%&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&lt;script runat="server"&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&amp;nbsp; void submitBtn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Encode the string input<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; AntiXSSLibrary.HtmlEncode(htmlInputTxt.Text));<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Selectively allow&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sb.Replace("&lt;b&gt;", "&lt;b&gt;");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sb.Replace("&lt;/b&gt;", "");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sb.Replace("&lt;i&gt;", "&lt;i&gt;");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sb.Replace("&lt;/i&gt;", "");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write(sb.ToString());<br />&amp;nbsp; }<br />&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
  </div>
  <pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;body&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:TextBox ID="htmlInputTxt" Runat="server" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; TextMode="MultiLine" Width="318px"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Height="168px"&gt;&lt;/asp:TextBox&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:Button ID="submitBtn" Runat="server" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Text="Submit" OnClick="submitBtn_Click" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
  <h1>Additional Considerations</h1>
  <p>In addition to the techniques discussed previously in this How to, use the following countermeasures as further safe guards to prevent cross-site scripting: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the correct character encoding. </li>
    <li>Do not rely on input sanitization. </li>
    <li>Use the HttpOnly cookie option. </li>
    <li>Use the &lt;frame&gt; security attribute. </li>
    <li>Use the innerText property instead of innerHTML. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Set the Correct Character Encoding</h2>
  <p>To successfully restrict valid data for your Web pages, you should limit the ways in which the input data can be represented. This prevents malicious users from using canonicalization and multi-byte escape sequences to trick your input validation routines. A multi-byte escape sequence attack is a subtle manipulation that uses the fact that character encodings, such as uniform translation format-8 (UTF-8), use multi-byte sequences to represent non-ASCII characters. Some byte sequences are not legitimate UTF-8, but they may be accepted by some UTF-8 decoders, thus providing an exploitable security hole.</p>
  <p>ASP.NET allows you to specify the character set at the page level or at the application level by using the &lt;<strong>globalization</strong>&gt; element in the Web.config file. The following code examples show both approaches and use the ISO-8859-1 character encoding, which is the default in early versions of HTML and HTTP.</p>
  <p>To set the character encoding at the page level, use the &lt;<strong>meta</strong>&gt; element or the <strong>ResponseEncoding</strong> page-level attribute as follows: </p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content Type" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1" /&gt;</pre>
    <pre>OR<br />&lt;% @ Page ResponseEncoding="iso-8859-1" %&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>To set the character encoding in the Web.config file, use the following configuration.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;configuration&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;system.web&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;globalization <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; requestEncoding="iso-8859-1"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; responseEncoding="iso-8859-1"/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/system.web&gt;<br />&lt;/configuration&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <h2>Validating Unicode Characters</h2>
  <p>Use the following code to validate Unicode characters in a page.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>using System.Text.RegularExpressions;<br />. . .</pre>
    <pre>public class WebForm1 : System.Web.UI.Page<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; private void Page_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Name must contain between 1 and 40 alphanumeric characters<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // and (optionally) special characters such as apostrophes&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // for names such as O'Dell</pre>
    <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (!Regex.IsMatch(Request.Form["name"],<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; @"^[\p{L}\p{Zs}\p{Lu}\p{Ll}\']{1,40}$"))<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; throw new ArgumentException("Invalid name parameter");</pre>
    <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Use individual regular expressions to validate other parameters<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; . . .<br />&amp;nbsp; }<br />}  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>The following explains the regular expression shown in the preceding code: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>^</strong> means start looking at this position. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>\p{ ..}</strong> matches any character in the named character class specified by <strong>{..}</strong>. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>{L}</strong> performs a left-to-right match. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>{Lu}</strong> performs a match of uppercase. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>{Ll}</strong> performs a match of lowercase. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>{Zs}</strong> matches separator and space. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>'</strong>matches apostrophe. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>{1,40}</strong> specifies the number of characters: no less than 1 and no more than 40. </li>
    <li>$ means stop looking at this position. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Do Not Rely on Input Sanitization</h2>
  <p>A common practice is for code to attempt to sanitize input by filtering out known unsafe characters. Do not rely on this approach because malicious users can usually find an alternative means of bypassing your validation. Instead, your code should check for known secure, safe input. Table 1 shows various safe ways to represent some common characters.</p>

  <h2>Use the HttpOnly Cookie Option</h2>
  <p>Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 and later supports an <strong>HttpOnly</strong> cookie attribute, which prevents client-side scripts from accessing a cookie from the <strong>document.cookie</strong> property. Instead, the script returns an empty string. The cookie is still sent to the server whenever the user browses to a Web site in the current domain.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Web browsers that do not support the <strong>HttpOnly</strong> cookie attribute either ignore the cookie or ignore the attribute, which means that it is still subject to cross-site scripting attacks.<strong></strong></blockquote>
  <p>The <strong>System.Net.Cookie</strong> class in Microsoft .NET Framework version 2.0 supports an <strong>HttpOnly</strong> property. The <strong>HttpOnly</strong> property is always set to true by Forms authentication. </p>
  <p>Earlier versions of the .NET Framework (versions 1.0 and 1.1) require that you add code similar to the following to the <strong>Application</strong>_<strong>EndRequest</strong> event handler in your application Global.asax file to explicitly set the <strong>HttpOnly</strong> attribute.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>protected void Application_EndRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e) <br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; string authCookie = FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName;<br />&amp;nbsp; foreach (string sCookie in Response.Cookies) <br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Just set the HttpOnly attribute on the Forms <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // authentication cookie.

  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (sCookie.Equals(authCookie))<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; { <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Force HttpOnly to be added to the cookie header<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Cookies[sCookie].Path += ";HttpOnly";<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp; }<br />}</pre>
  <h2>Use the &lt;frame&gt; Security Attribute</h2>
  <p>Internet Explorer 6 and later support a new <strong>security</strong> attribute for the &lt;<strong>frame</strong>&gt; and &lt;<strong>iframe</strong>&gt; elements. You can use the <strong>security</strong> attribute to apply the user's Restricted Sites Internet Explorer security zone settings to an individual frame or iframe. By default, the Restricted Sites zone does not support script execution. </p>
  <p>If you use the <strong>security</strong> attribute, it must be set to <strong>"restricted"</strong> as shown in the following.</p>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
      </div>
      <div>&amp;nbsp;</div>
    </div>
    <pre>&lt;frame security="restricted" src="http://www.somesite.com/somepage.htm"&gt;&lt;/frame&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <h2>Use the innerText Property Instead of innerHTML</h2>
  <p>If you use the <strong>innerHTML</strong> property to build a page and the HTML is based on potentially untrusted input, you must use <strong>HtmlEncode</strong> to make it safe. To avoid having to remember to do this, use <strong>innerText</strong> instead. The <strong>innerText</strong> property renders content safe and ensures that scripts are not executed.</p>
  <p>The following example shows this approach for two HTML &lt;<strong>span</strong>&gt; controls. The code in the <strong>Page_Load</strong> method sets the text displayed in the <strong>Welcome1</strong> &lt;<strong>span</strong>&gt; element using the <strong>innerText</strong> property, so HTML-encoding is unnecessary. The code sets the text in the <strong>Welcome2</strong> &lt;<strong>span</strong>&gt; element by using the <strong>innerHtml</strong> property; therefore, you must <strong>HtmlEncode</strong> it first to make it safe.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true"%&gt;</pre>
    <pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;body&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span id="Welcome1" runat="server"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span id="Welcome2" runat="server"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
  </div>
  <pre>&lt;script runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; private void Page_Load(Object Src, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Using InnerText renders the content safe-no need to HtmlEncode<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Welcome1.InnerText = "Hello, " + User.Identity.Name;</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Using InnerHtml requires the use of HtmlEncode to make it safe<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Welcome2.InnerHtml = "Hello, " + <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Server.HtmlEncode(User.Identity.Name);<br />&amp;nbsp; }<br />&lt;/Script&gt;</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Summary&amp;nbsp;</h1>
  <p>This How to shows how to use the Windows Data Protection application programming interface (DPAPI) protected configuration provider and the Aspnet_regiis.exe tool to encrypt sections of your configuration files. You can use the Aspnet_regiis.exe tool to
 encrypt sensitive data, such as connection strings, held in the Web.config and Machine.config files. The DPAPI protected configuration provider supports machine-level and user-level stores for key storage. The choice of store depends largely on whether or
 not your application shares a server with other applications and whether or not sensitive data must be kept private for each application. Note that if your application is deployed in a Web farm, you should use the RSA protected configuration provider due to
 the ease with which RSA keys can be exported.</p>

  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Know which sections can and cannot be encrypted with the DPAPI protected configuration provider.
</li>
    <li>Choose between user-level and machine-level DPAPI key storage. </li>
    <li>Use the DPAPI protected configuration provider to encrypt sections of your configuration file.
</li>
    <li>Learn about the Web farm restrictions. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>Configuration files such as the Web.config file are often used to hold sensitive information, including user names, passwords, database connection strings, and encryption keys. If you do not protect this information, your application is vulnerable to attackers
 or malicious users obtaining sensitive information such as account user names and passwords, database names and server names. The sections that usually contain sensitive information that you need to encrypt are the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&lt;appSettings&gt;. This section contains custom application settings. </li>
    <li>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;. This section contains connection strings. </li>
    <li>&lt;identity&gt;. This section can contain impersonation credentials. </li>
    <li>&lt;sessionState&gt;. The section contains the connection string for the out-of-process session state provider.
</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Encrypting and decrypting data incurs performance overhead. To keep this overhead to a minimum, encrypt only the sections of your configuration file that store sensitive data.</p>
  <h1>Summary of Steps</h1>
  <p>To encrypt configuration sections by using the DPAPI data protection provider, perform the following steps:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step 1. Identify the configuration sections to be encrypted. </li>
    <li>Step 2. Choose the machine or user store. </li>
    <li>Step 3. Encrypt your configuration file data. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Step 1. Identify the Configuration Sections to Be Encrypted</h1>
  <p>Encrypting and decrypting data incurs performance overhead. To keep this overhead to a minimum, encrypt only the sections of your configuration file that store sensitive data.</p>
  <h2>Sections You Cannot Encrypt Using Protected Configuration</h2>
  <p>If you store sensitive data in any of the following configuration sections, you cannot encrypt it by using protected configuration and the Aspnet_regiis.exe tool:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&lt;<strong>processModel</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>runtime</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>mscorlib</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>startup</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>system.runtime.remoting</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>configProtectedData</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>satelliteassemblies</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>cryptographySettings</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>cryptoNameMapping</strong>&gt; </li>
    <li>&lt;<strong>cryptoClasses</strong>&gt; </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For the configuration sections listed, you should use the Aspnet_setreg.exe tool, which is also available for previous versions of the .NET Framework.
</p>
  <p>For more information about using the Aspnet_setreg tool to encrypt data in these configuration sections, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 329290, How to use the ASP.NET utility to encrypt credentials and session state connection strings.</p>
  <h1>Step 2. Choose the Machine or User Store</h1>
  <p>The <strong>DataProtectionConfigurationProvider</strong> supports machine-level and user-level stores for key storage. The choice of store depends largely on whether or not your application shares a server with other applications and whether or not sensitive
 data must be kept private for each application.</p>
  <h2>Machine Store</h2>
  <p>Use machine-level key storage in the following situations: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your application runs on its own dedicated server with no other applications.
</li>
    <li>You have multiple applications on the same server that run and you want those applications to be able to share sensitive information.
</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>User Store</h2>
  <p>Use user-level key storage if you run your application in a shared hosting environment and you want to make sure that your application's sensitive data is not accessible to other applications on the server. In this situation, each application should run
 under a separate identity, and the resources for the application—such as files and databases—should be restricted to that identity.</p>
  <h1>Step 3. Encrypt Your Configuration File Data</h1>
  <p>This step shows you how to encrypt a connection string in the Web.config file, first with the machine store and then with the user store.</p>
  <h2>Using DPAPI with the Machine Store to Encrypt a Connection String in Web.config</h2>
  <p>By default, the <strong>DataProtectionConfigurationProvider</strong> is configured to use DPAPI with the machine store.
</p>
  <h3>To encrypt the connectionStrings section in Web.config </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new Web site named MachineDPAPI. Make sure that this directory is configured as a virtual directory.
</li>
    <li>Add a Web.config configuration file to this directory. </li>
    <li>Add a sample <strong>connectionString</strong> similar to the following example.
<div><pre>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;add name="MyLocalSQLServer" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connectionString="Initial Catalog=aspnetdb;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; data source=localhost;Integrated Security=SSPI;" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/&gt;<br />&lt;/connectionStrings&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>To encrypt the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section, run the following command from a .NET command prompt:
<p><strong>aspnet_regiis -pe "connectionStrings" -app "/MachineDPAPI" -prov "DataProtectionConfigurationProvider"</strong></p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>The above command with the <strong>-app</strong> switch assumes that there is an IIS virtual directory called MachineDPAPI. If you are using the Visual Studio Web server instead of IIS, use the
<strong>-pef</strong> switch, which allows you to specify the physical directory location of your configuration file.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>aspnet_regiis.exe -pef "connectionStrings" C:\Projects\MachineDPAPI -prov "DataProtectionConfigurationProvider"</strong>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Aspnet_regiis.exe utility tool is located in the following directory:</blockquote>
  <blockquote>%WinDir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\&lt;<em>versionNumber</em>&gt;</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>-pe</strong> switch specifies the configuration section to encrypt.
</li>
    <li>The <strong>-pef</strong> switch specifies the configuration section to encrypt and allows you to supply the physical directory path for your configuration file.
</li>
    <li>The <strong>-app</strong> switch specifies your Web application's virtual path. If it is a nested application, you need to specify the nested path from the root directory; for example,
<strong>"/test/aspnet/MachineDPAPI"</strong>. </li>
    <li>The <strong>-prov</strong> switch specifies the provider name.
<p>If the command is successful, you will see the following output: </p><div><pre>Encrypting configuration section...Succeeded!  </pre></div><blockquote><strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The DPAPI machine key is stored at the following location:</blockquote><blockquote>%windir%\system32\Microsoft\Protect\S-1-5-18</blockquote></li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Review the Web.config file, and examine the changes. The following elements are created:
<ul><li>&lt;<strong>EncryptedData</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>CipherData</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>CipherValue</strong>&gt; </li></ul><p>Your modified Web.config file, with the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section encrypted, should be similar to the following example.
</p><div><pre>...<br />&lt;connectionStrings configProtectionProvider="DataProtectionConfigurationProvider"&gt; <br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptedData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherData&gt;<br />&lt;CipherValue&gt;AQAAANCMnd8BFdERjHoAwE/Cl+sBAAAAexuIJ/8oFE+sGTs7jBKZdgQAAAACAAAAAAADZgAAqAAAA<br />BAAAAA<br />Kms84dyaCPAeaSC1dIMIBAAAAAASAAACgAAAAEAAAAKaVI6aAOFdqhdc6w1Er3HMwAAAAcZ00MZOz1dI7kYRvkMIn/<br />BmfrvoHNUwz6H9rcxJ6Ow41E3hwHLbh79IUWiiNp0VqFAAAAF2sXCdb3fcKkgnagkHkILqteTXh&lt;/CipherValue&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EncryptedData&gt;<br />&lt;/connectionStrings&gt;<br />...</pre></div></li>
    <li>Add the following Default.aspx Web page to your application's virtual directory, and then browse to this page to verify that encryption and decryption worked correctly.
<div><pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" %&gt;<br /><br />&lt;script runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write("Clear text connection string is: " + <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ["MyLocalSQLServer"].ConnectionString);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;body/&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>
      <p>MyLocalSQLServer is the name of the connection string that you previously specified in the Web.config file.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>To change the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section back to clear text, run the following command from the command prompt:
<p><strong>aspnet_regiis -pd "connectionStrings" -app "/MachineDPAPI"</strong></p><p>If the command is successful, you will see the following output: </p><div><pre>Decrypting configuration section...<br />Succeeded!</pre></div></li>
  </ol>
  <p>To decrypt the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section specifying a physical path to your application's configuration file, use the
<strong>-pdf</strong> switch as shown here.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>aspnet_regiis -pdf "connectionStrings" C:\Projects\MachineDPAPI</strong>
  </p>
  <h2>Using DPAPI with a User Store to Encrypt a Connection String in Web.Config</h2>
  <p>By default, the ASP.NET applications run under the NT AUTHORITY\Network Service account. When you access encrypted configuration sections using DPAPI with the user store, make sure that your application is running with the same user identity as the account
 you used to encrypt the data.</p>
  <p>Using the <strong>DataProtectionConfigurationProvider</strong> and DPAPI with the user store requires a small amount of additional configuration in the Web.config file.</p>
  <h3>To encrypt the connectionStrings section in Web.config </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new Web site named UserDPAPI. Make sure that this directory is configured as a virtual directory.
</li>
    <li>Add a Web.config configuration file to this directory. </li>
    <li>Add a sample <strong>connectionString</strong> similar to the following example.
<div><pre>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;add name="MyLocalSQLServer" connectionString="Initial Catalog=aspnetdb;<br />data source=localhost;Integrated Security=SSPI;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/&gt;<br />&lt;/connectionStrings&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>Add and configure a protected configuration provider to use the user store. To do this, add the following &lt;<strong>configProtectedData</strong>&gt; section. You must set
<strong>useMachineProtection</strong>=<strong> "false"</strong> to instruct the provider to use the user store. You must also use a unique provider name, or a run-time error will occur.
<div><pre>&lt;configProtectedData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;providers&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;add useMachineProtection="false" keyEntropy="" name="MyUserDataProtectionConfigurationProvider" <br />type="System.Configuration.DpapiProtectedConfigurationProvider, System.Configuration,<br />     Version=3.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/providers&gt;<br />&lt;/configProtectedData&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>Run the following command from a command prompt to encrypt the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section:
<p><strong>Aspnet_regiis -pe "connectionStrings" -app "/UserDPAPI" -prov "MyUserDataProtectionConfigurationProvider"</strong></p><ul><li>The -<strong>pe</strong> switch specifies the configuration section to encrypt.
</li><li>The -<strong>app</strong> switch specifies your Web application's virtual path. If it is a nested application, you need to specify the nested path from the root directory; for example:
<strong>"/test/aspnet/UserDPAPI"</strong>. </li><li>The -<strong>prov</strong> switch specifies the provider name. In this case, this is set to
<strong>"MyUserDataProtectionConfigurationProvider"</strong> which is the name you specified when configuring the provider in the step 3.
</li></ul><p>If the command is successful, you will see the following output: </p><div><pre>Encrypting configuration section...Succeeded!</pre></div></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Because your application must access the data by using the same identity that you used to encrypt the data, you may need to run the encryption command using your application's service account identity. To do so, you can start a command window by using the
<strong>runas</strong> command, specifying an appropriate domain and user name, as follows:</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Runas /profile /user:domain\user cmd</strong>
  </p>
  <p>When you run Aspnet_regiis from the resulting command window, it will use the specified identity to perform the encryption. This enables your application that uses the same identity to decrypt the data at run time.
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Review the Web.config file, and examine the changes. The following elements are created:
<ul><li>&lt;<strong>EncryptedData</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>CipherData</strong>&gt; </li><li>&lt;<strong>CipherValue</strong>&gt; </li></ul><p>Your modified Web.config file, with the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section encrypted should be similar to the following example.
</p><div><pre>...<br />&lt;connectionStrings configProtectionProvider="MyUserDataProtectionConfigurationProvider"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;EncryptedData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;CipherValue&gt;AQAAANCMnd8BFdERjHoAwE/Cl+sBAAAAWuizHyLxzk+U4/8NnMRAjQAAAAACAAAAA<br />AADZgAAqAAAABAAAADLFqu00qT0BeGh6wmHHGySAAAAAASAAACgAAAAEAAAAM56z6ezglmufZGcta83RKGgAQAA<br />tvDpExhD6h95lfWBt0FqZYzxupI2IepH/XlhLB5rsuuQDCJUL7XGIIsaVW2oNQxgNCPXxRSuCxHQ7vqgbh4G7xH<br />k0wdyws5Ax4T/RYJbfYEF5KAPzShdmdoZdkY/FOWrVEgAr7LzKFBoDcPJBvgX+lfsJdBNeWRB5BqRX552dUFjtDl<br />p8u3K/dA9twWDU2w/cRLMXJtVZ/y/ICI1fzXjX3u7sY9K1IC+5Hbi7nouCK6Ze5RLBnL0Zfdq0PyGlj2To4ftAYA<br />T0SzkBaxlXRQSzMhX+7c+rgKpMqtG9XjAW26x3IJAp2/uAr2zOZqH+tskamHYSruhTicHJDTtP+r6Rs21y2QkRT9<br />Hb9oPd9B5mDIzGtDkifWBbmwLv4XFuYcna1Zgny7McSxMI62jxayVlZKcS5dXV0shwLoUjbTDcXQmFKsRvo2sCW8<br />6wcN8ad02jhKCQMf9SWnZpd849mlqgMFiQQSFlZ6Q+vJLrXqVb8zmVZemQPQcY/DktgjOvjn0iOZ3zhl20fRENOa<br />3ZIWvvK8p9pblz3sEfS19MAW0JtYUAAAAayvNPot3An7LaCTdFYrEip+fTU4=&lt;/CipherValue&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/CipherData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EncryptedData&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;<br />...</pre></div></li>
    <li>Add the following Default.aspx Web page to your application's virtual directory, and then browse to this page to verify that encryption and decryption work correctly.
<div><pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" %&gt;&lt;script runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Response.Write("Clear text connection string is: " + <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ["MyLocalSQLServer"].ConnectionString);<br />&amp;nbsp; }<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;body/&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;  </pre></div><p>MyLocalSQLServer is the name of the connection string that you previously specified in the Web.config file.
</p><p>Then, in the Web.config file, you need to enable impersonation as shown in the following example.
</p><div><pre>&lt;system.web&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;identity impersonate="true" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&lt;/system.web&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>
      <p>If your application runs under a different account than the one used to encrypt the data, ASP.NET will be unable to access the user store where the DPAPI key is held and will generate the following error:
</p>
      <div>
        <pre>Failed to decrypt using provider 'MyUserDataProtectionConfigurationProvider'.<br />&amp;nbsp;Error message from the provider: Key not valid for use in specified state. <br />(Exception from HRESULT: 0x8009000B)  </pre>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>To change the <strong>connectionStrings</strong> section back to clear text, run the following command from the command prompt:
<p><strong>aspnet_regiis -pd "connectionStrings" -app "/UserDPAPI"</strong></p><p>If the command is successful, you will see the following output: </p><div><pre>Decrypting configuration section...<br />Succeeded!  </pre></div></li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Web Farm Scenarios</h1>
  <p>If you want to deploy the same encrypted configuration file on multiple servers in a Web farm, you should use the
<strong>RSAProtectedConfigurationProvider</strong>. This provider makes it easy for you encrypt the data on one server computer and then export the RSA private key needed to decrypt the data. You can then deploy the configuration file and the exported key to
 the target servers, and then re-import the keys.</p>

  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>ASP.NET&amp;nbsp;includes a role manager feature that includes a roles management API that allows you to create and delete roles and assign and remove users from roles. The role manager stores its data in an underlying data store that it accesses through an appropriate role provider for that data store.</p>
  <p>The main benefits of using role manager are that it allows you to look up users' roles without writing and maintaining code. Additionally, the role providers offer a consistent way for you to check the role membership of your users, regardless of the underlying data store. Therefore, if your role store were to change tomorrow, you would only need to change the configuration settings to make your code work.</p>
  <p>Supplied role providers include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>SqlRoleProvider.</strong> This is used where the role store is kept in SQL Server. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider.</strong> This is a read-only provider that retrieves role information for a Windows user account based on the account's Windows security group membership. You cannot create, add to, or delete roles with this provider. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider.</strong> This is used if your application uses Authorization Manager (AzMan). It uses an AzMan policy store in an XML file, in Active Directory, or in Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) as its role store. It is typically used in an intranet or extranet scenario where Windows authentication and Active Directory is used for authentication. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>To perform role management, your ASP.NET application must be able to identify and authenticate its users in some way. For example, it might use Windows authentication or Forms authentication.</p>
  <p>This How to shows you how to set up and configure a role store and a role provider and use role-based authorization in your ASP.NET applications. Additionally, it demonstrates some of the basic roles API calls available to work with roles programmatically.</p>
  <h1>Summary of Steps</h1>
  <p>To use the role manager in your application, perform the following steps: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step 1. Configure your role store. </li>
    <li>Step 2. Configure your role provider in Web.config. </li>
    <li>Step 3. Create and assign roles. </li>
    <li>Step 4. Perform role-based authorization. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Step 1. Configure Your Role Store </h1>
  <p>In this step, you prepare the role store used to maintain role details. The setup details vary according to the store and associated provider that you choose to use.</p>
  <h2>Using SqlRoleProvider</h2>
  <p>If you want to store roles in SQL Server, you use the <strong>SqlRoleProvider</strong>. By default, roles are stored in a database named Aspnetdb in a SQL Express database instance in the \app_data folder beneath your application's virtual directory root folder. You can also configure the <strong>SqlRoleProvider</strong> to use a local or remote instance of SQL Server.</p>
  <h3>To use a SQL Express database role store in the Website \app_data folder</h3>
  <p>You do not have to create or configure this database. The first time you perform an operation that uses the role management API, ASP.NET automatically creates a database named Aspnetdb, configures it, and sets appropriate permissions on it. </p>
  <p>ASP.NET configures the SQL Express database with a database login for the default accounts used to run ASP.NET applications (Network Service on Windows Server 2003 or later&amp;nbsp;and ASPNET on Windows 2000) and grants them full access to the Aspnetdb database. </p>
  <p>If you have configured ASP.NET to run using a custom service account, you must create a SQL login for that account, and add the login to the <strong>aspnet_Roles_FullAccess</strong> role in the Aspnetdb database. </p>
  <p>
    <strong>To install the role management database in SQL Server</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Log on to Windows using an account that has administration rights for your SQL Server instance. </li>
    <li>Open a command prompt window and execute the following command to install the role management database. <p><strong>Aspnet_regsql.exe</strong>-<strong>E</strong>-<strong>S</strong><em>sqlinstance</em>-<strong>A r</strong></p><p>Note that this program is located in the <strong>%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\{version}</strong> folder. </p><p>When you type the command, replace <em>version</em> with the version of the .NET Framework that you are using and <em>sqlinstance</em> with the name of the SQL Server instance you want to install the role management database in. </p><p>You will see the following output: </p><div><pre>Start adding the following features:<br />Rolemanager<br />............<br />Finished.  </pre></div><blockquote><strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For information about the switches for Aspnet_regsql.exe, type <strong>Aspnet_regsql.exe -?</strong> at the command prompt.</blockquote></li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>To grant permissions in the database</strong>
  </p>
  <p>You need to create a database login for your Web application's process account; by default, this is the Network Service account. If you have configured a custom account to run ASP.NET, you must grant permissions to that account. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you have configured your ASP.NET application to use impersonation, your ASP.NET application executes using the security context of the original caller. To access data in a SQL Server database, you must usually create a database login for the original caller and grant access to the required data.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>However, the role management system accesses the Aspnetdb database by using the process identity regardless of whether your application uses impersonation. </blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Open SQL Server Enterprise Manager, expand <strong>Security</strong>, and then expand <strong>Logins</strong> for the server hosting the role management database. Create a new login for your Web application's process account (for example, <strong>NT AUTHORITY/Network Service</strong>). </li>
    <li>Set the default database to <strong>Aspnetdb</strong>. </li>
    <li>Under the <strong>Databases</strong> node in Enterprise Manager, expand the <strong>Aspnetdb</strong> database entry, and then click <strong>Roles</strong>. Right-click <strong>aspnet_Roles_FullAccess</strong>, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>. In the <strong>Database Role Properties</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Add</strong>, and then select the database login you created in the previous step to add the login to that role. <blockquote><strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Aspnet_regsql.exe creates three database roles with differing levels of access to the role management database: </blockquote><ul><li><strong>FullAccess</strong> gives rights to create and delete roles, and add and remove users from those roles. </li><li><strong>BasicAccess</strong> allows role membership checks for the current user only. </li><li><strong>ReportingAccess</strong> allows a page to check which roles exist and which users belong to them. </li></ul></li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Using WindowsTokenRoleProvider</h2>
  <p>You use the <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong> with ASP.NET applications that use Windows authentication. It is a read-only provider that retrieves role information for a Windows user based on Windows security groups. You cannot create, add to, or delete roles with this provider. Instead, you must use the Windows Computer Management or Active Directory Users and Computers administration tools.</p>
  <p>The Windows security system acts as role store for this provider, so no additional configuration is required to set up the role store.</p>
  <h2>Using AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</h2>
  <p>Use the <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong> to store roles data in an AzMan policy store in an XML file, in Active Directory, or ADAM. </p>
  <p>AzMan is supported on Windows 2000 Server or later and on Windows XP Professional.&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <h1>Step 2. Configure Your Role Provider in Web.config</h1>
  <p>In this step, you configure the appropriate role provider in your application's Web.config file.</p>
  <h2>Using SqlRoleProvider</h2>
  <p>To use the role store in the default SQL Express instance in a database in your Web site's \app_dir folder, add the following configuration to your application's Web.config file.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;system.web&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;roleManager enabled="true" /&gt;<br />&lt;/system.web&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>This configuration enables role management and causes your application to use the default provider named <strong>AspNetSqlRoleProvider</strong> defined in the Machine.config file. This uses the local SQL Express instance.</p>
  <p>To use a role store in SQL Server, add a connection string to point to your role database and add a role provider definition in the Web.config file, as shown here.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;configuration&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;connectionStrings&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;add name="SqlRoleManagerConnection" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connectionString="Data Source=sqlinstance;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Initial Catalog=aspnetdb;Integrated Security=SSPI;"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/add&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;<br />&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>
  </div>
  <pre>&lt;roleManager enabled="true" defaultProvider="SqlRoleManager"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;providers&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;add name="SqlRoleManager" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; type="System.Web.Security.SqlRoleProvider"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connectionStringName="SqlRoleManagerConnection"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; applicationName="MyApplication" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/providers&gt;<br />&lt;/roleManager&gt;</pre>
  <h2>Using WindowsTokenRoleProvider</h2>
  <p>The Windows security system acts as role store for this provider, and Windows groups represent roles. You can use this provider when you use Windows authentication. To do this, add the following configuration to your application's Web.config file.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;authentication mode="Windows" /&gt;<br />&lt;roleManager enabled="true" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; defaultProvider="AspNetWindowsTokenRoleProvider" /&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>This configuration enables role management and uses the role provider named <strong>AspNetWindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong>, which is defined in the Machine.config file.</p>
  <h2>Using AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</h2>
  <p>The <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong> is used to store roles data in an AzMan policy store in an XML file, in Active Directory, or in ADAM. To configure this provider, add a connection string to point to the relevant policy store and then add a role provider definition in the Web.config file.</p>
  <p>The following connection string refers to an XML-based policy store contained in a file named Azmanstore.xml.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;configuration&gt; <br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;connectionStrings&gt; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;add name="AzManPolicyStoreConnectionString" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connectionString="msxml://c:/RolesData/azmanstore.xml" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt; <br />&lt;/configuration&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>The following connection string refers to an ADAM-based policy store.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;configuration&gt; <br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;connectionStrings&gt; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;add name="AzManPolicyStoreConnectionString" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connectionString= "msldap://servername:port/CN=AzManADAMStore,<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; OU=SecNetPartition,O=SecNet,C=US"/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt; <br />&lt;/configuration&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>The following configuration shows how to enable role management and use the provider named <strong>RoleManagerAzManADAMProvider</strong>. This uses the connection string shown earlier to connect to an ADAM policy store.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;roleManager <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; enabled="true" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cacheRolesInCookie="true" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; defaultProvider="RoleManagerAzManADAMProvider"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cookieName=".ASPXROLES" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cookiePath="/" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cookieTimeout="30" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cookieRequireSSL="false" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cookieSlidingExpiration="true"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; createPersistentCookie="false" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cookieProtection="All"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;providers&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;add name="RoleManagerAzManADAMProvider"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; type="System.Web.Security.AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider, System.Web,<br />     Version=3.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, publicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connectionStringName="AzManPolicyStoreConnectionString" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; applicationName="AzManDemo"/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/providers&gt;<br />&lt;/roleManager&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <h1>Step 3. Create and Assign Roles</h1>
  <p>In this step, you create roles for your application and assign users to those roles. There are several methods you can use to create and assign roles. Using them depends on how your application authenticates its users and which role provider it uses. The various methods for creating and assigning users to roles include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>At development time, you can use the ASP.NET configuration tool. </li>
    <li>If you are using the <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong>, you can use the AzMan administrator Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in. </li>
    <li>You can create roles programmatically by using either the role management APIs or, if you are using the <strong>SqlRoleProvider</strong>, by executing SQL scripts to add them to the database directly. </li>
    <li>If you are using the <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong>, you use the Windows Computer Management tool or Active Directory Users and Computers to create Windows groups which are used as roles. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Using the ASP.NET Web Site Configuration Tool</h2>
  <p>You can use the ASP.NET Web Site Configuration tool from Visual Studio .NET at development time if your application uses Forms authentication and you have configured your application to use the ASP.NET membership feature. If your application uses Windows authentication, you cannot use this tool and you must use either the Roles API or the AzMan administrator MMC snap-in as described in the next section. </p>
  <h3>To assign users to roles by using the ASP.NET Web Site Configuration tool </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create roles by using the ASP.NET configuration tool by performing the following steps: <ol><li>Start Visual Studio. </li><li>On the <strong>Website</strong> menu, click <strong>ASP.NET Configuration</strong>. </li><li>On the <strong>Home</strong> tab, click <strong>Security</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Create or</strong><strong>Manage Roles</strong>. </li><li>Use the form to add your application roles. </li></ol></li>
    <li>Assign users to roles as follows: <ol><li>In Visual Studio .NET, click <strong>ASP.NET Configuration </strong>on the <strong>Website</strong> menu. </li><li>On the <strong>Home</strong> tab, click <strong>Security</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Create or</strong><strong>Manage Roles</strong>. </li><li>In the <strong>Add/Remove Users</strong> column, click <strong>Manage</strong> for a role you have created. This opens a form where you can add or remove users from the role. </li></ol></li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Using the AzMan Administrator MMC Snap-In</h2>
  <p>This tool is provided for applications that use an AzMan store to manage its users and roles. It is particularly convenient for applications using Windows authentication that cannot use the ASP.NET configuration tool to assign users to roles. </p>
  <h2>Using SQL Scripts</h2>
  <p>If you have suitable permissions on the role management database, you can run a SQL script to call the various stored procedures provided with the Aspnetdb database. For example, the following script creates a new role in an application and adds a user to it.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>EXEC aspnet_Roles_CreateRole 'ThisApplication', 'NewRole'<br />EXEC aspnet_UsersInRoles_AddUsersToRoles 'ThisApplication', 'ThisUser', 'NewRole', 8  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>There are 19 role-managing stored procedures created inside the role management database. Most of these stored procedures have purposes analogous to calls in the role management API. </p>
  <h2>Using the Role Management APIs</h2>
  <p>You can assign users to roles or remove users from roles by using methods of the <strong>System.Web.Security.Roles</strong> class. You can also check for the user's role membership and authorize as appropriate.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Because the <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong> is read-only, it supports only the <strong>IsUserInRole</strong> and <strong>GetRolesForUser </strong>methods.<strong></strong></blockquote>
  <p>The following code shows how to create new roles.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>using System.Web.Security;</pre>
    <pre>if (!Roles.RoleExists("TestRole"))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; Roles.CreateRole("TestRole");<br />}  </pre>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Role names are not case sensitive. If you attempt to create the same role twice, an exception is thrown.</blockquote>
  <p>The following code shows how to add users to roles.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>// Example 1 - Add one user to one role<br />Roles.AddUserToRole("TestOne", "ExampleRole1");</pre>
    <pre>// Example 2 - Add one user to several roles<br />Roles.AddUserToRoles("TestTwo", <br />&amp;nbsp; new string[] { "ExampleRole1", "ExampleRole2" });</pre>
    <pre>// Example 3 - Add several users to one roles<br />Roles.AddUsersToRole(<br />&amp;nbsp; new string[] { "TestTwo", "TestThree" }, "ExampleRole3");</pre>
    <pre>// Example 4 - Add several users to several roles<br />Roles.AddUsersToRoles(<br />&amp;nbsp; new string[] { "TestThree", "TestFour" }, <br />&amp;nbsp; new string[] { "ExampleRole4" }); </pre>
  </div>
  <p>The following code shows how to remove users from roles.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>// Example 1 - Add one user to one role<br />Roles.RemoveUserFromRole("TestOne", "ExampleRole1");</pre>
    <pre>// Example 2 - Add one user to several roles<br />Roles.RemoveUserFromRoles("TestTwo", <br />&amp;nbsp; new string[] { "ExampleRole1", "ExampleRole2" });</pre>
    <pre>// Example 3 - Add several users to one roles<br />Roles.RemoveUsersFromRole(<br />&amp;nbsp; new string[] { "TestTwo", "TestThree" }, "ExampleRole3");</pre>
    <pre>// Example 4 - Add several users to several roles<br />Roles.RemoveUsersFromRoles(<br />&amp;nbsp; new string[] { "TestThree", "TestFour" }, <br />&amp;nbsp; new string[] { "ExampleRole4" }); </pre>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Both the <strong>AddUser</strong> and <strong>RemoveUser</strong> methods throw a <strong>TargetInvocationException</strong> if you specify a role that does not exist or if you specify an invalid Windows user account name. The inner exception gives the reason for the failure. None of the methods mentioned earlier can be used against a <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong>.</blockquote>
  <h1>Step 4. Perform Role-Based Authorization </h1>
  <p>In this step, you create test applications that use role management. This step provides two samples: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The first sample uses the <strong>SqlRoleProvider</strong> or <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong>, in which the application assigns a role to a user, removes a role from a user, and tests for role membership. </li>
    <li>The second sample uses the <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong> to check which Windows groups (roles) the current user is a member of. The <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong> supports only the<strong> IsUserInRole </strong>and <strong>GetRolesForUser </strong>methods of the role management API, and it does not allow you to create, assign to, or remove users from Windows groups. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Both of these sample applications use Integrated Windows authentication in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) to authenticate callers. This is a requirement when using the <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong>, but if you are using the <strong>SqlRoleProvider</strong> or <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong>, you could use alternative authentication such as forms authentication.</p>
  <h2>Sample: Using SqlRoleProvider or AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</h2>
  <p>This sample uses the <strong>SqlRoleProvider</strong> or <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong>.</p>
  <h3>To test role management with SqlRoleProvider or AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Use Visual Studio to create a Web site, add a Web.config file, and configure the role store and <strong>SqlRoleProvider</strong> or <strong>AuthorizationStoreRoleProvider</strong> as described in steps 1 and 2 of this How to. </li>
    <li>Using the Internet Information Services MMC snap-in, edit the properties of the Web site. Edit the <strong>Anonymous access and authentication control</strong> on the <strong>Directory</strong><strong>security</strong> tab.

    <strong>To control access to pages and folders using roles</strong>
  </p>
  <p>A typical use for roles is to establish rules that allow or deny access to pages or folders. You can set up such access rules in the &lt;<strong>authorization</strong>&gt; section of the Web.config file. The following example allows users in the role of members to view pages in the folder named <strong>memberPages</strong> and denies access to anyone else.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;configuration&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;location path="memberPages"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;system.web&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;authorization&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;allow roles="Manager" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;deny users="*" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/authorization&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/system.web&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/location&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;!-- other configuration settings here --&gt;<br />&lt;configuration&gt;  </pre>

  <h2>Sample: Using WindowsTokenRoleProvider</h2>
  <p>This sample uses the <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong>.</p>
  <h3>To test role management with WindowsTokenRoleProvider </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Use Visual Studio&amp;nbsp;to create a Web site, add a Web.config file, and configure the <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong> as described in step 2 of this How to. </li>
    <li>Using the Internet Information Services MMC snap-in, edit the properties of the Web site. Edit the <strong>Anonymous access and authentication control</strong> on the <strong>Directory security</strong> tab. Clear the <strong>Anonymous access</strong> check box and select the <strong>Integrated Windows Authentication</strong> check box. </li>
    <li>In the Web.config file, enable Windows authentication. <div><pre>&lt;system.web&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;authentication mode="Windows"/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&lt;/system.web&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>Add the following code to Default.aspx. <div><div><div></div></div><pre>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" %&gt;<br />&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd</a>"&gt;<br />&lt;script runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; string[] members = Roles.GetRolesForUser();<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; foreach (string role in members)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Label1.Text += role + "&lt;br /&gt;";<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; } <br />&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;html&amp;nbsp; &gt;<br />&lt;head runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;title&gt;Untitled Page&lt;/title&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;<br />&lt;body&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:Label ID="Label1" runat="server" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;  </pre></div></li>
    <li>Run the application. A list of roles that correspond to the Windows groups that the authenticated user is a member of is displayed. Note the following features about this application: <ol><li>Because <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong> is read-only, you cannot create, assign to, or remove users from roles. The <strong>WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong> supports only the <strong>IsUserInRole </strong>and <strong>GetRolesForUser</strong> methods of the role management API. </li></ol></li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>The text of <strong>Label1</strong> shows which Windows groups the currently logged on user is a member of. </li>
    <li>The <strong>WindowsPrincipal </strong>class supports an override of the <strong>IsInRole</strong> method that accepts a <strong>WindowsBuiltinRole</strong> enumeration. This method allows you to test against membership of common Windows groups. The <strong>WindowsBuiltInRole</strong> enumeration contains members representing common groups such as Administrators, Guest, PowerUser, and User as shown here. <div><div><div></div><div>&amp;nbsp;</div></div><pre>WindowsPrincipal User = new <br />&amp;nbsp; WindowsPrincipal((WindowsIdentity)HttpContext.Current.User.Identity);<br />if (User.IsInRole(WindowsBuiltInRole.PowerUser))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; ...<br />}  </pre></div></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>To control access to pages and folders using built-in roles with the WindowsTokenRoleProvider</strong>
  </p>
  <p>You can control access to pages or folders to members of one of the built-in Windows groups by specifying the role in the format <strong>BUILTIN\<em>groupName</em></strong>. The following example allows users in the built-in administrators group to view pages in the folder named memberPages and denies access to anyone else.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;configuration&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;location path="memberPages"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;system.web&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;authorization&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;allow roles="BUILTIN\Administrators" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;deny users="*" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/authorization&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/system.web&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/location&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;!-- other configuration settings here --&gt;<br />&lt;/configuration  </pre>
  </div>
  <h1>Additional Considerations</h1>
  <p>If a user's browser accepts cookies, you can store role information for that user in a cookie on the user's computer. On each page request, ASP.NET reads the role information for that user from the cookie. This can improve application performance by reducing the amount of communication required with the roles data store. </p>
  <p>To configure and enable role caching, set <strong>cacheRolesInCookie = true</strong> as shown here.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;roleManager enabled="true" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cacheRolesInCookie="true" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cookieName=".ASPXROLES"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cookieTimeout="30" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cookiePath="/" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cookieRequireSSL="false" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cookieSlidingExpiration="true"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; cookieProtection="All" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; defaultProvider="AspNetSqlRoleProvider"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; createPersistentCookie="false" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; maxCachedResults="25"/&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>If the role information for a user is too long to store in a cookie, ASP.NET stores only the most recently used role information in the cookie, and then it looks up additional role information in the data source as required. </p>
  <p>To secure the role cookie: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set <strong>cookieRequireSSL</strong> to <strong>true</strong> to ensure the cookie is only used over an SSL protected channel. </li>
    <li>Set <strong>createPersistentCookie</strong> to <strong>false</strong> to prevent the cookie from being stored on the client computer, in which case the cookie is only used to protect the current session. </li>
    <li>Set <strong>cookieTimeout</strong> to the number of minutes for which the cookie is valid.</li>
  </ul>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>This How to shows a number of ways to help protect your ASP.NET application from SQL injection attacks. SQL injection can occur when an application uses input to construct dynamic SQL statements or when it uses stored procedures to connect to the database. Conventional security measures, such as the use of SSL and IPSec, do not protect your application from SQL injection attacks. Successful SQL injection attacks enable malicious users to execute commands in an application's database.</p>
  <p>Countermeasures include using a list of acceptable characters to constrain input, using parameterized SQL for data access, and using a low privileged account that has restricted permissions in the database. Using stored procedures with parameterized SQL is the recommended approach because SQL parameters are type safe. Type-safe SQL parameters can also be used with dynamic SQL. In situations where parameterized SQL cannot be used, consider using character escaping techniques. </p>

  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn how SQL injection attacks work. </li>
    <li>Constrain input to prevent SQL injection. </li>
    <li>Use type safe SQL command parameters to prevent SQL injection. </li>
    <li>Use a low privileged account to connect to the database.&amp;nbsp; </li>
    <li>Learn additional countermeasures to further reduce risk. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>A successful SQL injection attack enables a malicious user to execute commands in your application's database by using the privileges granted to your application's login. The problem is more severe if your application uses an over-privileged account to connect to the database. For example, if your application's login has privileges to eliminate a database, then without adequate safeguards, an attacker might be able to perform this operation.</p>
  <p>Common vulnerabilities that make your data access code susceptible to SQL injection attacks include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Weak input validation. </li>
    <li>Dynamic construction of SQL statements without the use of type-safe parameters. </li>
    <li>Use of over-privileged database logins. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>SQL Injection Example</h2>
  <p>Consider what happens when a user types the following string in the <strong>SSN</strong> text box, which is expecting a Social Security number of the form <em>nnn-nn-nnnn</em>.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>' ; DROP DATABASE pubs  --  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>Using the input, the application executes the following dynamic SQL statement or stored procedure, which internally executes a similar SQL statement. </p>
  <div>
    <pre>// Use dynamic SQL<br />SqlDataAdapter myCommand = new SqlDataAdapter(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "SELECT au_lname, au_fname FROM authors WHERE au_id = '" + <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; SSN.Text + "'", myConnection);</pre>
  </div>
  <pre>// Use stored procedures<br />SqlDataAdapter myCommand = new SqlDataAdapter(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "LoginStoredProcedure '" + <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; SSN.Text + "'", myConnection);<br /></pre>
  <p>The developer's intention was that when the code runs, it inserts the user's input and generates a SQL the following statement.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>SELECT au_lname, au_fname FROM authors WHERE au_id = '172-32-9999'  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>However, the code inserts the user's malicious input and generates the following query.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>SELECT au_lname, au_fname FROM authors WHERE au_id = ''; DROP DATABASE pubs --'  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>In this case, the <strong>'</strong> (single quotation mark) character that starts the rogue input terminates the current string literal in the SQL statement. It closes the current statement only if the following parsed token does not make sense as a continuation of the current statement but does make sense as the start of a new statement. As a result, the opening single quotation mark character of the rogue input results in the following statement.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>SELECT au_lname, au_fname FROM authors WHERE au_id = ''  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>The<strong>;</strong> (semicolon) character tells SQL that this is the end of the current statement, which is then followed by the following malicious SQL code.</p>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <a class="copyCode" href="javascript:CopyCode('ctl00_LibFrame_ctl09');">
        </a>&amp;nbsp;</div>
    </div>
    <pre>; DROP DATABASE pubs  </pre>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The semicolon is not necessarily required to separate SQL statements. This is dependent on vendor or implementation, but Microsoft SQL Server does not require them. For example, SQL Server parses the following as two separate statements:</blockquote>
  <blockquote>SELECT * FROM MyTable DELETE FROM MyTable</blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Finally, the <strong>--</strong> (double dash) sequence of characters is a SQL comment that tells SQL to ignore the rest of the text. In this case, SQL ignores the closing <strong>'</strong> (single quotation mark) character, which would otherwise cause a SQL parser error.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>--'  </pre>
  </div>
  <h2>Guidelines</h2>
  <p>To counter SQL injection attacks, you need to: </p>

      <strong>Constrain and sanitize input data. </strong>Check for known good data by validating for type, length, format, and range. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use type-safe SQL parameters for data access.</strong> You can use these parameters with stored procedures or dynamically constructed SQL command strings. Parameter collections such as <strong>SqlParameterCollection</strong> provide type checking and length validation. If you use a parameters collection, input is treated as a literal value, and SQL Server does not treat it as executable code. An additional benefit of using a parameters collection is that you can enforce type and length checks. Values outside of the range trigger an exception. This is a good example of defense in depth. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use an account that has restricted permissions in the database.</strong> Ideally, you should only grant execute permissions to selected stored procedures in the database and provide no direct table access. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid disclosing database error information. </strong>In the event of database errors, make sure you do not disclose detailed error messages to the user. </li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Summary of Steps</h1>
  <p>To protect your application from SQL injection, perform the following steps: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step 1. Constrain input. </li>
    <li>Step 2. Use parameters with stored procedures. </li>
    <li>Step 3. Use parameters with dynamic SQL.<strong></strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Step 1. Constrain Input</h1>
  <p>You should validate all input to your ASP.NET applications for type, length, format, and range. By constraining the input used in your data access queries, you can protect your application from SQL injection. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When constraining input, it is a good practice to create a list of acceptable characters and use regular expressions to reject any characters that are not on the list. The potential risk associated with using a list of unacceptable characters is that it is always possible to overlook an unacceptable character when defining the list; also, an unacceptable character can be represented in an alternate format to pass validation. </blockquote>
  <h2>Constrain Input in ASP.NET Web Pages</h2>
  <p>Start by constraining input in the server-side code for your ASP.NET Web pages. Do not rely on client-side validation because it can be easily bypassed. Use client-side validation only to reduce round trips and to improve the user experience.</p>
  <p>If you use server controls, use the ASP.NET validator controls, such as the <strong>RegularExpressionValidator</strong> and <strong>RangeValidator</strong> controls to constrain input. If you use regular HTML input controls, use the <strong>Regex</strong> class in your server-side code to constrain input.</p>
  <p>If in the previous code example, the SSN value is captured by an ASP.NET <strong>TextBox</strong> control, you can constrain its input by using a <strong>RegularExpressionValidator</strong> control as shown in the following.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>&lt;%@ language="C#" %&gt;<br />&lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:TextBox ID="SSN" runat="server"/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;asp:RegularExpressionValidator ID="regexpSSN" runat="server"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ErrorMessage="Incorrect SSN Number" <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ControlToValidate="SSN"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ValidationExpression="^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}$" /&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>If the SSN input is from another source, such as an HTML control, a query string parameter, or a cookie, you can constrain it by using the <strong>Regex</strong> class from the <strong>System.Text.RegularExpressions</strong> namespace. The following example assumes that the input is obtained from a cookie.</p>
  <p>using System.Text.RegularExpressions;</p>
  <div>
    <pre>if (Regex.IsMatch(Request.Cookies["SSN"], "^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}$"))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // access the database<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // handle the bad input<br />}  </pre>
  </div>
  <h2>Constrain Input in Data Access Code</h2>
  <p>In some situations, you need to provide validation in your data access code, perhaps in addition to your ASP.NET page-level validation. Two common situations where you need to provide validation in your data access code are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Untrusted clients.</strong> If the data can come from an untrusted source or you cannot guarantee how well the data has been validated and constrained, add validation logic that constrains input to your data access routines. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Library code. </strong>If your data access code is packaged as a library designed for use by multiple applications, your data access code should perform its own validation, because you can make no safe assumptions about the client applications. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following example shows how a data access routine can validate its input parameters by using regular expressions prior to using the parameters in a SQL statement.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>using System;<br />using System.Text.RegularExpressions;</pre>
  </div>
  <pre>public void CreateNewUserAccount(string name, string password)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Check name contains only lower case or upper case letters, <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // the apostrophe, a dot, or white space. Also check it is <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // between 1 and 40 characters long<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if ( !Regex.IsMatch(userIDTxt.Text, @"^[a-zA-Z'./s]{1,40}$"))<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; throw new FormatException("Invalid name format");</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Check password contains at least one digit, one lower case <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // letter, one uppercase letter, and is between 8 and 10 <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // characters long<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if ( !Regex.IsMatch(passwordTxt.Text, <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; @"^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z]).{8,10}$" ))<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; throw new FormatException("Invalid password format");</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; // Perform data access logic (using type safe parameters)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />}</pre>
  <h1>Step 2. Use Parameters with Stored Procedures</h1>
  <p>Using stored procedures does not necessarily prevent SQL injection. The important thing to do is use parameters with stored procedures. If you do not use parameters, your stored procedures can be susceptible to SQL injection if they use unfiltered input as described in the "Overview" section of this document.</p>
  <p>The following code shows how to use <strong>SqlParameterCollection</strong> when calling a stored procedure.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>using System.Data;<br />using System.Data.SqlClient;</pre>
    <pre>using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; DataSet userDataset = new DataSet();<br />&amp;nbsp; SqlDataAdapter myCommand = new SqlDataAdapter( <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "LoginStoredProcedure", connection);<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add("@au_id", SqlDbType.VarChar, 11);<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters["@au_id"].Value = SSN.Text;</pre>
    <pre>&amp;nbsp; myCommand.Fill(userDataset);<br />}  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>In this case, the <strong>@au_id</strong> parameter is treated as a literal value and not as executable code. Also, the parameter is checked for type and length. In the preceding code example, the input value cannot be longer than 11 characters. If the data does not conform to the type or length defined by the parameter, the <strong>SqlParameter</strong> class throws an exception.</p>
  <h2>Review Your Application's Use of Parameterized Stored Procedures</h2>
  <p>Because using stored procedures with parameters does not necessarily prevent SQL injection, you should review your application's use of this type of stored procedure. For example, the following parameterized stored procedure has several security vulnerabilities.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.RunQuery@var ntextAS<br />        exec sp_executesql @varGO  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>An application that uses a stored procedure similar to the one in the preceding code example has the following vulnerabilities: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The stored procedure executes whatever statement is passed to it. Consider the <strong>@var</strong> variable being set to: <div><pre>DROP TABLE ORDERS;  </pre></div><p>In this case, the ORDERS table will be dropped. </p></li>
    <li>The stored procedure runs with <strong>dbo</strong> privileges. </li>
    <li>The stored procedure's name (<strong>RunQuery</strong>) is a poor choice. If an attacker is able to probe the database, he or she will see the name of the stored procedure. With a name like <strong>RunQuery</strong>, he can guess that the stored procedure is likely to run the supplied query. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Step 3. Use Parameters with Dynamic SQL</h1>
  <p>If you cannot use stored procedures, you should still use parameters when constructing dynamic SQL statements. The following code shows how to use <strong>SqlParametersCollection</strong> with dynamic SQL.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>using System.Data;<br />using System.Data.SqlClient;</pre>
  </div>
  <pre>using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; DataSet userDataset = new DataSet();<br />&amp;nbsp; SqlDataAdapter myDataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "SELECT au_lname, au_fname FROM Authors WHERE au_id = @au_id", <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connection);&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add("@au_id", SqlDbType.VarChar, 11);<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters["@au_id"].Value = SSN.Text;<br />&amp;nbsp; myDataAdapter.Fill(userDataset);<br />}</pre>
  <h2>Using Parameter Batching</h2>
  <p>A common misconception is that if you concatenate several SQL statements to send a batch of statements to the server in a single round trip, you cannot use parameters. However, you can use this technique if you make sure that parameter names are not repeated. You can easily do this by making sure that you use unique parameter names during SQL text concatenation, as shown here.</p>
  <div>
    <pre>using System.Data;<br />using System.Data.SqlClient;<br />. . .<br />using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; SqlDataAdapter dataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "SELECT CustomerID INTO #Temp1 FROM Customers " +<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "WHERE CustomerID &gt; @custIDParm; SELECT CompanyName FROM Customers " +<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "WHERE Country = @countryParm and CustomerID IN " +<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(SELECT CustomerID FROM #Temp1);",<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connection);<br />&amp;nbsp; SqlParameter custIDParm = dataAdapter.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "@custIDParm", SqlDbType.NChar, 5);<br />&amp;nbsp; custIDParm.Value = customerID.Text;</pre>
    <pre>&amp;nbsp; SqlParameter countryParm = dataAdapter.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "@countryParm", SqlDbType.NVarChar, 15);<br />&amp;nbsp; countryParm.Value = country.Text;</pre>
    <pre>&amp;nbsp; connection.Open();<br />&amp;nbsp; DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();<br />&amp;nbsp; dataAdapter.Fill(dataSet);<br />}<br />. . .  </pre>
  </div>
  <h1>Additional Considerations</h1>
  <p>Other things to consider when you develop countermeasures to prevent SQL injection include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use escape routines to handle special input characters. </li>
    <li>Use a low privileged database account.&amp;nbsp; </li>
    <li>Avoid disclosing error information. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Use Escape Routines to Handle Special Input Characters</h2>
  <p>In situations where parameterized SQL cannot be used and you are forced to use dynamic SQL instead, you need to safeguard against input characters that have special meaning to SQL Server (such as the single quote character). If not handled, special characters such as the single quote character in the input can be utilized to cause SQL injection. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Special input characters pose a threat only with dynamic SQL and not when using parameterized SQL. </blockquote>
  <p>Escape routines add an escape character to characters that have special meaning to SQL Server, thereby making them harmless. This is illustrated in the following code fragment:</p>
  <div>
    <pre>private string SafeSqlLiteral(string inputSQL){  return inputSQL.Replace("'", "''");</pre>
  </div>
  <p>}</p>
  <h2>Use a Least-Privileged Database Account</h2>
  <p>Your application should connect to the database by using a least-privileged account. If you use Windows authentication to connect, the Windows account should be least-privileged from an operating system perspective and should have limited privileges and limited ability to access Windows resources. Additionally, whether or not you use Windows authentication or SQL authentication, the corresponding SQL Server login should be restricted by permissions in the database.</p>
  <p>Consider the example of an ASP.NET application running on Microsoft Windows Server 2003 that accesses a database on a different server in the same domain. By default, the ASP.NET application runs in an application pool that runs under the Network Service account. This account is a low privileged account.</p>
  <h3>To access SQL Server with the Network Service account </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a SQL Server login for the Web server's Network Service account. The Network Service account has network credentials that are presented at the database server as the identity <em>DOMAIN</em>\<em>WEBSERVERNAME</em>$. For example, if your domain is called XYZ and the Web server is called 123, you create a database login for XYZ\123$. </li>
    <li>Grant the new login access to the required database by creating a database user and adding the user to a database role. </li>
    <li>Establish permissions to let this database role call the required stored procedures or access the required tables in the database. Only grant access to stored procedures the application needs to use, and only grant sufficient access to tables based on the application's minimum requirements. <p>For example, if the ASP.NET application only performs database lookups and does not update any data, you only need to grant read access to the tables. This limits the damage that an attacker can cause if the attacker succeeds in a SQL injection attack. </p></li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Avoid Disclosing Error Information</h2>
  <p>Use structured exception handling to catch errors and prevent them from propagating back to the client. Log detailed error information locally, but return limited error details to the client. </p>
  <p>If errors occur while the user is connecting to the database, be sure that you provide only limited information about the nature of the error to the user. If you disclose information related to data access and database errors, you could provide a malicious user with useful information that he or she can use to compromise your database security. Attackers use the information in detailed error messages to help deconstruct a SQL query that they are trying to inject with malicious code. A detailed error message may reveal valuable information such as the connection string, SQL server name, or table and database naming conventions.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>The preferred approach to validating input is to constrain what you allow from the beginning. It is much easier to validate data for known valid types, patterns, and ranges than it is to validate data by looking for known bad characters. When you design your application, you know what your application expects. The range of valid data is generally a more finite set than potentially malicious input. However, for defense in depth you may also want to reject known bad input and then sanitize the input.</p>
  <p>To create an effective input validation strategy, be aware of the following approaches and their tradeoffs: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Constrain input. </li>
    <li>Validate data for type, length, format, and range. </li>
    <li>Reject known bad input. </li>
    <li>Sanitize input. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Constrain Input</h3>
  <p>Constraining input is about allowing good data. This is the preferred approach. The idea here is to define a filter of acceptable input by using type, length, format, and range. Define what is acceptable input for your application fields and enforce it. Reject everything else as bad data.</p>
  <p>Constraining input may involve setting character sets on the server so that you can establish the canonical form of the input in a localized way.</p>
  <h3>Validate Data for Type, Length, Format, and Range</h3>
  <p>Use strong type checking on input data wherever possible, for example, in the classes used to manipulate and process the input data and in data access routines. For example, use parameterized stored procedures for data access to benefit from strong type checking of input fields.</p>
  <p>String fields should also be length checked and in many cases checked for appropriate format. For example, ZIP codes, personal identification numbers, and so on have well defined formats that can be validated using regular expressions. Thorough checking is not only good programming practice; it makes it more difficult for an attacker to exploit your code. The attacker may get through your type check, but the length check may make executing his favorite attack more difficult.</p>
  <h3>Reject Known Bad Input</h3>
  <p>Deny "bad" data; although do not rely completely on this approach. This approach is generally less effective than using the "allow" approach described earlier and it is best used in combination. To deny bad data assumes your application knows all the variations of malicious input. Remember that there are multiple ways to represent characters. This is another reason why "allow" is the preferred approach.</p>
  <p>While useful for applications that are already deployed and when you cannot afford to make significant changes, the "deny" approach is not as robust as the "allow" approach because bad data, such as patterns that can be used to identify common attacks, do not remain constant. Valid data remains constant while the range of bad data may change over time.</p>
  <h3>Sanitize Input</h3>
  <p>Sanitizing is about making potentially malicious data safe. It can be helpful when the range of input that is allowed cannot guarantee that the input is safe. This includes anything from stripping a null from the end of a user-supplied string to escaping out values so they are treated as literals.</p>
  <p>Another common example of sanitizing input in Web applications is using URL encoding or HTML encoding to wrap data and treat it as literal text rather than an executable script. HtmlEncode methods escape out HTML characters, and UrlEncode methods encode a URL so that it is a valid URI request.</p>
  <h3>In Practice</h3>
  <p>The following are examples applied to common input fields, using the preceding approaches: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Last Name field</strong>. This is a good example where constraining input is appropriate In this case, you might allow string data in the range ASCII A-Z and a-z, and also hyphens and curly apostrophes (curly apostrophes have no significance to SQL) to handle names such as O'Dell. You would also limit the length to your longest expected value. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Quantity field</strong>. This is another case where constraining input works well. In this example, you might use a simple type and range restriction. For example, the input data may need to be a positive integer between 0 and 1000. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Free-text field</strong>. Examples include comment fields on discussion boards. In this case, you might allow letters and spaces, and also common characters such as apostrophes, commas, and hyphens. The set that is allowed does not include less than and greater than signs, brackets, and braces. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some applications might allow users to mark up their text using a finite set of script characters, such as bold "&lt;b&gt;", italic "&lt;i&gt;", or even include a link to their favorite URL. In the case of a URL, your validation should encode the value so that it is treated as a URL. </p>
  <p>An existing Web application that does not validate user input. In an ideal scenario, the application checks for acceptable input for each field or entry point. However, if you have an existing Web application that does not validate user input, you need a stopgap approach to mitigate risk until you can improve your application's input validation strategy. While neither of the following approaches ensures safe handling of input, because that is dependent on where the input comes from and how it is used in your application, they are in practice today as quick fixes for short-term security improvement: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML-encoding and URL-encoding user input when writing back to the client. In this case, the assumption is that no input is treated as HTML and all output is written back in a protected form. This is sanitization in action. </li>
    <li>Rejecting malicious script characters. This is a case of rejecting known bad input. In this case, a configurable set of malicious characters is used to reject the input. As described earlier, the problem with this approach is that bad data is a matter of context. </li>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>An encryption key is a secret number used as input to the encryption and decryption processes. For encrypted data to remain secure, the key must be protected. If an attacker compromises the decryption key, your encrypted data is no longer secure.</p>
  <p>The following practices help secure your encryption keys: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use&amp;nbsp;platform provided&amp;nbsp;key management. </li>
    <li>Cycle your keys periodically. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Use&amp;nbsp;Platform Provided&amp;nbsp;Key Management</strong>
  </p>
  <p>One of the major advantages of using platform provided key management is that the key management issue is handled by the operating system. For example, if you are using the .NET framework, you can use DPAPI to handle key management. The key that DPAPI uses is derived from the password that is associated with the process account that calls the DPAPI functions. You can use DPAPI to pass the burden of key management to the operating system.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cycle Your Keys Periodically</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Generally, a static secret is more likely to be discovered over time. Questions to keep in mind are: Did you write it down somewhere? Did Bob, the administrator with the secrets, change positions in your company or leave the company? Do not overuse keys.</p>]]></Data>

  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that unique tokens are included in HTTP requests:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Examine code that performs sensitive operations.</strong> Review each page that allows calling sensitive operations to make sure that it sends a unique token with the request in a hidden field.

  <p>Passing user input to external processes increases the risk of command injection vulnerabilities. This risk may be partially mitigated by removing any special characters from user input before passing it to external processes.</p>
  <h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>If you need to use dynamically-generated query strings or commands in spite of the risk, properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass
 an extremely strict whitelist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Divide your software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use use centralized authentication. Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction
 with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on
 one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port. In general, if the software or protocol
 allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be done throughout.</p>
  <h2>Why</h2>
  <p>Compartmentalizing software allows you to limit the amount of damage that can be done to a system. You can divide the system into a collection of isolated units so that even if one component is breached, the entire system is not compromised. Compartmentalization
 separates resources, data, users, and processes from one another.</p>
  <h2>When</h2>
  <p>Designing an application architecture is best done in the early stages of the project. Later on, the architecture can be strengthened gradually over time.
</p>
  <h2>How</h2>
  <p>To provide separation between components:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Compartmentalize users.</strong> You should never provide the same set of permissions on application resources to different users. The separation of users ensures that even if one user's account is compromised, other accounts remain secure. Use role-based
 and user-based authorization to enforce separation of users. For role-based authorization, the roles need to be defined. Additionally, you need to determine the type of resources that can be accessed by a group of users. For user-based authorization, determine
 the type of resources that can only be accessed by specific users.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Compartmentalize processes.</strong> Break your applications into a collection of well-defined functional components. Each of these components should have its own specific purpose. This separation applies even more when dealing with critical operations
 and processes, such as credit card transactions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Compartmentalize data.</strong> Data should be stored separately depending on its sensitivity and purpose:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Store data in a database on a nonpublicly accessible machine. </li>
        <li>Place Web-root on a separate partition from OS installation. </li>
        <li>Segment data by the authorization level required to access it (database tables, config files, Web folders).
</li>
        <li>Separate databases/tables for storing different types of data and create different database users with privileges limited to their needs.
</li>
        <li>On the file system, assign permissions carefully, granting only the privileges a given process needs.</li>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>Implementing protections that prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) within a Servlet/JSP application.</p>
  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <p>CSRF is a powerful attack that allows an attacker to force a victim to execute functionality within an application on behalf of the attacker. The example below gives an example of how to prevent CSRF within a JSP application.</p>
  <h1>Scenarios</h1>
  <p>CSRF is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious web site causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated, causing the victim to perform activities on behalf of the attacker. In order to prevent CSRF, the most common effective solution currently used is the synchronizer token pattern. The flow below shows the basic steps in prevention.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>To add unique tokens to HTTP requests using plain JSP:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Store a randomly generated token for each authenticated user.</strong> Upon successful authentication of a user, store a randomly generated (using a secure pseudo-random number generator such as <em>java.security.SecureRandom</em>) string (token) in the <em>HttpSession</em> for the user.</p>
      <pre>
        <p>//in authentication function</p>
        <p>session.setAttribute("csrfToken", generateCSRFToken());</p>
        <p>//sample implementation of token generation</p>
        <p>public static String generateCSRFToken() {</p>
        <p>	SecureRandom rng = new SecureRandom();</p>
        <p>	int length = 64;</p>
        <p>	String characters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";</p>
        <p>	char[] text = new char[length];</p>
        <p>	for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {</p>
        <p>		text[i] = characters.charAt(rng.nextInt(characters.length()));</p>
        <p>	}</p>
        <p>	return String.valueOf(text);</p>
        <p>}</p>
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Add security tokens to transaction pages.</strong> For any function in the application representing a transaction (ie. causes a server side state change), the associated client form should have a hidden form field containing the token retrieved from the session.</p>
      <pre>
        <p>&lt;h:form&gt;</p>
        <p>	...</p>
        <p>	&lt;input id="token" type="hidden" value="${sessionScope.csrfToken}" /&gt;</p>
        <p>	...</p>
        <p>&lt;/h:form&gt;</p>
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that server-side and client-side tokens match.</strong> For any function in the application representing a transaction (ie. causes a server side state change), the associated server-side request processing code should retrieve the token from the session. It should then compare that token to the submitted token from the client for the given request. If the tokens match, the transaction may be processed. If the tokens do not match, the transaction should not be processed, and the associated request should be treated as an attack and dealt with accordingly.</p>
      <pre>
        <p>//in your servlet or other web request handling code</p>
        <p>public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {</p>
        <p>	...</p>
        <p>	HttpSession session = request.getSession();</p>
        <p>	String storedToken = (String)session.getAttribute("csrfToken");</p>
        <p>	String token = request.getParameter("token");</p>
        <p>	//do check</p>
        <p>	if (storedToken.equals(token)) {</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Reduce the lifetime of sessions to mitigate the risk of session hijacking and replay attacks.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Even when using SSL, there's still&amp;nbsp;a risk of session hijacking and replay; there are lots of other out-of-band ways to steal session tokens.&amp;nbsp; The shorter the session timeout, however, the less time an attacker has to capture a session cookie and use it to access your application.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All applications should consider the length of their sessions carefully, and any application protecting any sensitive information should make it as short as possible.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>There are two pieces of information that need to be handled to limit the session lifetime.&amp;nbsp; The first is the actual session cookie and the second is the server side session state.&amp;nbsp; With most frameworks, each time the user takes an action on the site the timestamps on the session cookie&amp;nbsp;and the corresponding field in the server-side session state&amp;nbsp;are both reset to the current time.&amp;nbsp; If someone attempts to use an expired cookie, the timestamp in the server-side session state for that session is checked and the request is disallowed.&amp;nbsp; If the session is old enough that the server-side state has been deleted, it's denied immediately.&amp;nbsp; In web farms, the timestamp may be embedded in the cookie and cryptographically signed, freeing up servers from the need to keep a single explicit session-state table.</p>
  <p>Most web application frameworks will handle the details for you, so you'll only need to specify a simple timeout value.&amp;nbsp; In some situations, you'll be able to choose whether the session timer should reset after each action (an idle timer, the default) or if it should be a single fixed timer from the initial login (an absolute timer).&amp;nbsp; The latter is useful for fast transactions and especially security critical situations.</p>
  <p>For most situations, thirty minutes is the maximum that an idle session should be accepted.&amp;nbsp; For sites which handle sensitive information, ten minutes is more appropriate.&amp;nbsp; If you want to allow a user to browse a site and let sessions sit for long periods of time and retain a customized experience, you can seperate out the cookies that control site customization from those that control access to more sensitive information or functionality; the customization cookies can be persisted while the actual session is expired.</p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>A web site uses the default (one hour) session time set by their web application framework.&amp;nbsp; When a user in an internet cafe forgets to log off, an attacker using the machine after them can browse to the site and use the old session to gain access to the victim's sensitive information.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>A web site locks down its session timeouts to ten minutes, overriding the default set by their web application framework.&amp;nbsp; When a user in an internet cafe forgets to log off, an attacker using the machine after them cannot browse to the site and use the old session to gain access to the victim's sensitive information, because the session has already expired.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Select a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and select well-tested implementations. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be available for analysis. For example, US government systems
 require FIPS 140-2 certification. When you use industry-approved techniques, you need to use them correctly. Don't cut corners by skipping resource-intensive steps (CWE-325). These steps are often essential for preventing common attacks.</p>
  <p>Do not develop your own cryptographic algorithms. They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If your algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how it works, then
 it is especially weak.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>As commercially available computing power rapidly increases and new threats emerge, it becomes more and more important to use strong cryptographic algorithms to secure sensitive data. Strong cryptographic algorithms assure that an attacker cannot break encryption
 in a timely manner.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Use this guideline whenever your application handles sensitive data.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to encrypt sensitive data:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive data.</strong> Review your application design to determine what kinds of sensitive data your application handles.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose cryptographic algorithms.</strong> Strong symmetric algorithms are AES and, to a lesser extent, 3-DES. Strong assymetric encryption algorithms are RSA, Elliptic Curve, and NTRU. The recommended key strengths are: 256-bit or more for AES, 3-DES
 key length is fixed at 168-bit, 1024-bit or more for RSA, 384-bit for Elliptic Curve cryptography, and 80-bit for NTRU.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose libraries and APIs.</strong> Find libraries that implement your chosen cryptographic algorithms. In some cases, they may be implemented by the platform. Find out the APIs for using these algorithms.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Implement encryption.</strong> Add functions to your applications that uses your chosen cryptographic APIs to encrypt and decrypt all the types of sensitive data that your application handles.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use encryption.</strong> Find code that handles sensitive data. Add code that calls your new encryption functions to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data as appropriate.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Enumerate the different types of users and create specific roles for them. When authorizing access to a resource, build the security checks on a per-role basis rather than on a per-user basis.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Application roles allow administrators to group users into categories that need the same level of privileges. The mechanism provides an easy and clear way to discover and manage the least privileges necessary for the execution of a given task. It provides a more robust and flexible way of managing the application's users.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application uses access control and authorizes its users to application resources.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps when designing role-based security:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Understand the different types of users. </strong>Enumerate the different types of users needed for the application. Understand how they will use the application and to which resources they will need access. Create a matrix mapping the actions each role is authorized to perform with the corresponding system components. Use this matrix to identify the different types of users according to the functionality they need. Creating a threat model may be a useful step to ensure that you correctly understand the implications of this matrix.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Establish the roles. </strong>Define which resources can be accessed by each role. There are two approaches when enforcing role-based security - programmatic and declarative.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>The programmatic approach.</strong> The programmatic approach to role-based security is written inside the code and provides additional runtime flexibility. It allows your application to dynamically create and assign roles so that user privileges can be granted and revoked without the need of restarting your application. When using the programmatic approach to role-based security, place access control checks at the appropriate locations in your application. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>The declarative approach.</strong> The declarative approach to role-based security is done via the configuration files. It allows easy manageability as the declarations can be modified without having to recompile. By using the declarative approach, you can easily manage the security settings for large portions of the application without changing the source code. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Manage the users.</strong> Assign the users into their respective user roles. The application should enforce the security policy according to the user roles instead of the actual user.</p>

  <p>Calculate the amount of memory used by an array or a string correctly.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Calculating the amount of memory used by an array or a string is very important when copying data to make sure that a sufficiently large buffer is allocated. Allocating a large enough buffer to fit data being copied is vital for preventing buffer overflows.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>The amount of memory used by an array or a string should be calculated when copying data.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the<i> sizeof()</i> function to determine the size of an array. Do not pass a pointer as an argument to <i>sizeof()</i> when calculating the size of an array. When an array is passed to a function as a parameter, it is passed as a pointer. If that function then calls <i>sizeof()</i> using that pointer as an argument, <i>sizeof()</i> will return the size of the pointer, not the size of the array. To get the amount of memory used by an array or a string correctly, use <i>sizeof()</i> in the same scope in which the array or string is declared. Store the memory size of an array or a string as a variable and pass it as an argument to other functions when it is necessary to know the size of the array or string outside of the scope where it is declared.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <p>Programming languages such C and Perl that use format string functions</p>
  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>Programming languages such C and Perl use string functions, like printf(), that allow users to pass a format for the input string.&amp;nbsp; Attackers can manipulate the input parameters passed to these functions to make the function work differently.&amp;nbsp; Attackers can use format string bugs to overwrite parts of the stack, corrupt memory, and crash the system.&amp;nbsp; They can use this vulnerability to execute different kind of attacks such as elevation of privileges, authentication bypass, information disclosure, and denial of services.</p>
  <p>Note that since Perl is interpreted, it doesn't suffer from all the problems present in C.&amp;nbsp; In C the attacker can get execution control of the program similar to buffer overrun attacks.&amp;nbsp; In Perl, on the other hand, the most common attacks are denial of service due to resource consumption, information disclosure, and unwanted modification of variables.</p>
  <p>Below is a summary of steps needed for testing for format string bugs</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Step 1</b>:&amp;nbsp; Understand attack scenarios </li>
    <li>
      <b>Step 2</b>:&amp;nbsp; List high risk components<b></b>and<b></b>entry points </li>
    <li>
      <b>Step 3</b>:&amp;nbsp; Start testing and exploring </li>
    <li>
      <b>Step 4</b>:&amp;nbsp; Tune test case data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <b>Step 1:&amp;nbsp; Understand Attack Scenarios</b>
  </p>
  <p>To realize a format string attack the attacker needs to find a vulnerable format string function and gain control of its input.&amp;nbsp; A common attack will look like the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Attacker discovers format string vulnerability </li>
    <li>Attacker modifies input parameters with attack data </li>
    <li>Attacker observes the results</li>
  </ol>
  <p>A common format string bug looks like this:</p>
  <pre>int func (char * buffer)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; printf(buffer);<p /><p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return 0;<br />}</p></pre>
  <p>The programming error is to not use printf("%s", buffer).&amp;nbsp; The attacker can exploit the code above by adding format specifiers to input variable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If the buffer contains the "%n" string the application is very likely to crash.&amp;nbsp; Using this string an attacker can start a denial of service attack.&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <p>Functions that copy a string to another like sprint() are even more dangerous.&amp;nbsp; For instance, below&amp;nbsp; the first sprint copies input to buffer setting allowing maximum eight characters to be copied:</p>
  <pre>void func(char * input) {&amp;nbsp;<br />char&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; buffer[16];<br />char&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; message[16];<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sprintf (buffer, "Name: %.8s", input);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sprintf (message, buffer);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; printf(message);&amp;nbsp;<br />}&amp;nbsp;</pre>
  <p>If an attacker feeds a large string of A's then the message is properly managed:</p>
  <pre>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; </pre>
  <p>outputs the following string:</p>
  <pre>"Name: AAAAAAAA"</pre>
  <p>But when the attacker inserts format string characters to the input string the result is a buffer overrun:</p>
  <pre>"%.30dAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"</pre>
  <p>The %.30d allocates a thirty character string and then appends A's at the end of it.&amp;nbsp; When doing the second copy, the buffer overruns the message and EIP ends of being x41414141.&amp;nbsp; This bug can be used to gain control of the application's execution and run arbitrary code.</p>
  <pre>"%.30d&lt;payload code&gt;"</pre>
  <p>Inside of the payload code placeholder in the above, the attacker can insert executable code to run malicious commands that execute with the privileges of the attacked program, similar to buffer overflow attacks.&amp;nbsp; These commands can include installing a Trojan, opening a remote shell, and propagating a worm, among others.</p>
  <p>Format string bugs can also lead to information disclosure attacks as when the getting debug information using the %x tag or to execute repudiation attacks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <b>Step 2: List High Risk Components and Entry Points</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <i>Identify high risk components</i>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>The next step in format string vulnerability testing is to identify all uses of the family of format string API's.&amp;nbsp; When having access to the code, this task can be done as a quick code review or using string searches over the source code directories.&amp;nbsp; If no access to the code is given, then use black box approaches such as API monitoring, network sniffing, and debugging to isolate the binary components or design modules that use these functions.</p>
  <p>The following C functions are vulnerable to this bug:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>printf </li>
    <li>wprintf </li>
    <li>sprintf </li>
    <li>swprintf </li>
    <li>fprintf </li>
    <li>fwprintf </li>
    <li>vprintf </li>
    <li>scanf </li>
    <li>fscanf </li>
    <li>sscanf </li>
    <li>fwscanf </li>
    <li>wscanf </li>
    <li>swscanf </li>
    <li>snprintf</li>
  </ul>
  <p />
  <p>Win32 also provides a set of replacement printf() functions such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>StringCbPrintf </li>
    <li>StringCbPrintfEx </li>
    <li>StringCchPrintf&amp;nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Perl is also vulnerable to format strings through these functions in particular</p>
  <ul>
    <li>printf </li>
    <li>sprintf&amp;nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> This list doesn't contain all format string functions.&amp;nbsp; There are many more functions that take a format string as an argument, including a large number of functions who's primary purpose is something separate, even though they still invoke a sprintf-like function along the way.&amp;nbsp; Always check the latest programming library documentation for your platform to properly cover all format strings issues.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Different versions of C (Unix vs. Microsoft for instance) have different format string functions.&amp;nbsp; Make sure to look at the documentation for all variants of format string manipulation functions. </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <i>Match high risk components with entry points</i>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>After listing all the high risk modules, examine all the ways in which you can bass format data to the high risk components.&amp;nbsp; This is similar to walking all paths from each high risk component back to the attacker; each path is an entry point.&amp;nbsp; Common entry points for format string components include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>User Interface </li>
    <li>API parameters </li>
    <li>Network packets </li>
    <li>File contents </li>
    <li>Memory sections </li>
    <li>Registry keys and values </li>
    <li>URL contents </li>
    <li>IPC Pipes </li>
    <li>Database queries</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Every component using format string functions gathers its input from entry points like the ones above.&amp;nbsp; Make a relation of all the high risk components identified with their entry points during this step.&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <b>Step 3:&amp;nbsp; Start Testing and Exploring</b>
  </p>
  <p>During this step start testing the application with common attack vectors and watch the application reaction to them.</p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <i>Attach a debugger</i>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>Attaching a debugger is a basic task in testing for format strings.&amp;nbsp; Any crash in the application due to access violations will break into the debugger.&amp;nbsp; The tester can then use debug information to determine if the crashes are exploitable such as buffer or heap overflows.<u></u></p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <i>Start with simple fuzz strings</i>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>The next step is to start testing with basic strings and observe how the application reacts to them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The next string can yield in a crash very fast:</p>
  <pre>%n%s</pre>
  <p>Feed the above string to the application and look for a crash in the debugger.&amp;nbsp; Then keep trying basic fuzz strings are look both at the debugger and at the application's output (message box, UI, web page, etc) depending on the case.&amp;nbsp; Look at the output when testing %x since it may divulge memory locations.&amp;nbsp; Look at the debugger when testing strings expansions such as %128d.</p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <i>Continue with common fuzz vectors</i>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>Continue exploring different flags passed to format string functions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The OWASP fuzz vectors show&amp;nbsp;a comprehensive list of what to try first:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>%s%p%x%d </li>
    <li>.1024d </li>
    <li>%.2049d </li>
    <li>%p%p%p%p </li>
    <li>%x%x%x%x </li>
    <li>%d%d%d%d </li>
    <li>%s%s%s%s </li>
    <li>%99999999999s </li>
    <li>%08x </li>
    <li>%%20d </li>
    <li>%%20n </li>
    <li>%%20x </li>
    <li>%%20s </li>
    <li>%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s </li>
    <li>%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p </li>
    <li>%#0123456x%08x%x%s%p%d%n%o%u%c%h%l%q%j%z%Z%t%i%e%g%f%a%C%S%08x%% </li>
    <li>%s x 129 </li>
    <li>%x x 257</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <b>Step 4:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Tune test case data</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <i>Modify test data according its entry points</i>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>The next step is to continue modifying test strings based on each of the entry points.&amp;nbsp; For example, if the application receives strings from a file it is necessary to modify the string values of a file.&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <p>The hex editor shows that the machine name "BOX 01" is stored at offset 164 and in UNICODE (zeros in between).&amp;nbsp; Therefore to test the %n string tune it to look like the one below (hex Unicode) and insert it at this offset:</p>
  <pre>\x25\x00\x6E\x00</pre>
  <p>Another example of data tuning is it is going through the URL.&amp;nbsp; If your application uses the URL to get the variable name then pass the following string to it:</p>
  <pre>http://www.xvulnerablesite.com/input.php?name=%25n<p /></pre>
  <p />
  <p>
    <b>
      <i>Try different payloads:</i>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>There are different payloads depending on what the attacker might want to do.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Next are some examples of additional payloads:</p>
  <p>
    <i>Denial of service due to crash. -&amp;nbsp; </i>passing strings such as these to vulnerable system leads to a crash almost always:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>%n </li>
    <li>%s </li>
    <li>%1024d</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <i>Denial of service due to memory consumption. -&amp;nbsp; </i>passing the string below causes the application to allocate an extremely long string and consume excessive memory:</p>
  <pre>%9999999s</pre>
  <p>
    <i>Denial of service due to integer overflow. - </i>&amp;nbsp;passing a float type in a string can cause a nearby integer to be affected:</p>
  <pre>%.650f </pre>
  <p>
    <i>Information disclosure from the stack:</i> - <i>passing</i> the following strings reveal the pointer location and stack:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>%p </li>
    <li>%x%x%x%x</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Conclusions</h1>
  <p>Testing for format string bugs is straight forward.&amp;nbsp; An important step is to identify well all entry points to format strings and test through them.&amp;nbsp; Then tune test cases based on entry point and payload to execute.&amp;nbsp; Pay attention to how the application reacts to each test case using the debugger, system and network monitoring tools, and the output and behavior of the application under test.</p>

  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>Perform input validation using Struts 1 within an application.</p>
  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <p>Strong input validation is a powerful control that can prevent various security issues within an application. This article will describe how to use the built-in mechanisms provided by Struts 1 to perform appropriate input validation.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>There are 2 basic ways to perform input validation within Struts1: overriding the <em>validate()</em> method in the form bean and using the validator mechanism.</p>
  <h3>1. Overriding the validate() method.</h3>
  <p>If you use the <em>ActionForm</em> class (or some subclass) to handle your user input, you can simply override the validate method within your class and have the framework call this method in order to perform validation. Below is an example of a simple form bean</p>
  <pre>public class MyForm extends ActionForm {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; private String title;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; public ActionErrors validate(ActionMapping mapping, HttpServletRequest request) { <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; //very important - call super first before any validations<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ActionErrors errors = super.validate(mapping,request);&amp;nbsp; </pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (errors == null) errors = new ActionErrors();<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (title == null) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; //"errors.required" message is defined in message bundle for app<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; errors.add(ActionErrors.GLOBAL_ERROR, new ActionError("errors.required","Title"));<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (errors.empty()) return null;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return errors;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />}</pre>
  <p>The next step is to define the form bean as is typical for the application in the <em>struts-config.xml</em> file.</p>
  <pre>&lt;form-bean name="myForm" type="com.myapp.struts.form.MyForm" /&gt;</pre>
  <p>Finally (also in the <em>struts-config.xml</em> file) you need to define your action, and tell struts that validation should be enabled. This will cause the framework to validate your form when the action is submitted.</p>
  <pre>&lt;action path="..." name="myForm" validate="true" ... /&gt;</pre>
  <h3>2. Using the validator framework.</h3>
  <p>Using the Struts validator framework involves including 2 additional files, the <em>validator-rules.xml</em> (the actual validations, many defaults provided for you) and <em>validation.xml</em> (ties validations to application forms) files.</p>
  <p>You'll also need to tweak the <em>struts-config.xml</em> file by adding the configuration shown below:</p>
  <pre>&lt;!--&amp;nbsp; Validator plugin --&gt;<br />&lt;plug-in className="org.apache.struts.validator.ValidatorPlugIn"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;set-property<br />&amp;nbsp; property="pathnames"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; value="/WEB-INF/validator-rules.xml,/WEB-INF/validation.xml"/&gt;<br />&lt;/plug-in&gt;</pre>
  <p>You'll likely want to use the <em>DynaValidatorForm</em> or some subclass since it is very convenient to use when working with the validation framework. An example login form configured this way is shown here: </p>
  <pre>&lt;form-beans&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form-bean name="LoginForm" type="org.apache.struts.validator.DynaValidatorForm"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form-property name="userName" type="java.lang.String" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form-property name="password" type="java.lang.String" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form-bean&gt;<br />&lt;/form-beans&gt;</pre>
  <p>Since the <em>validator-rules.xml</em> file covers many standard validations, you'll essentially need to alter the <em>validation.xml</em> file to account for your new form validations. Below is an example covering the login form.</p>
  <pre>&lt;form-validation&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;formset&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form name="LoginForm"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;field property="userName" depends="required"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;arg key="LoginForm.userName"/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/field&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;field property="password" depends="required,minlength"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;arg0 key="LoginForm.password"/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;arg1 key="${var:minlength}" name="minlength" resource="false"/&gt;</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;var&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;var-name&gt;minlength&lt;/var-name&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;var-value&gt;6&lt;/var-value&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/var&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/field&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/formset&gt;<br />&lt;/form-validation&gt;</pre>
  <p>Now that these pieces are in place, you configure your standard action as shown below and ensure validation is enabled in order to perform validation. </p>
  <pre>&lt;action path="..." name="LoginForm" validate="true" ... /&gt;</pre>
  <p>Whether you choose to validate using the code-driven validate method or the configuration-driven validator framework, you can display errors to the user on the UI using the <em>ActionError</em> or <em>ActionErrors</em> tags provided by Struts. This will allow you to display the error messages directly to the user in a localized manner. </p>
  <p>In conclusion, input validation can function as a strong security control if used properly and applied thoroughly throughout the application. The Struts framework provides 2 options for accomplishing this task. </p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use prepared statements to execute SQL queries. Do not generate SQL statements directly from user input.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Prepared statements mitigate the number one risk for database-facing Web applications: SQL injection. This powerful attack is language independent, as it depends on the algorithm used to generate SQL strings passed to the database and affects the database engine, not the actual application. It exploits the creation of the SQL string, in which user input is embedded manually with escape sequences (such as the single quote (') or double quote (") characters). Using this method, an attacker inserts valid SQL statement fragments as part of user input so they, in turn, are embedded within the SQL query that is submitted to the database engine for execution. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially compromise the entire database and often the underlying operating system. </p>
  <p>Prepared statements offer a simple yet efficient mitigation since they automatically contain user-input in a non-escaped form, passing the input as parameters, much like a function call. By parameterizing input parameters and type-enforcing them, user input is effectively filtered.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Type-safe SQL parameters should be used whenever SQL statements need to be executed by the database.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify SQL queries. </strong>Locate all SQL queries throughout your application. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify the parameters in each SQL query.</strong> After locating all SQL queries, identify the parameters in each query. Understand the format and type of each parameter's data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use prepared statements for SQL queries.</strong> Substitute the parameters in SQL queries with question marks ("?"). The basic steps for writing a prepared statement are: get a database handle, call the prepare function to make the prepared statement, use the bindParam function to bind prepared statement parameters to variables, load data into the variables, and call the execute function to execute the prepared statement. For examples and more information about writing prepared statements in PHP, please see the link at the bottom of this article. One example of a prepared statement is:</p>
      <pre>// Create the prepared statement. Notice the ?, which defines the parameter.<br />$preparedStatement = $databaseHandle-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE Name =&amp;nbsp; ?");<br />// Bind a variable to the parameter.<br />$preparedStatement-&gt;bindParam(1, $name);<br />// Load data into the parameter.<br />$name = "Joe";<br />// Execute the prepared statement.<br />$preparedStatement-&gt;execute();</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Compartmentalize your system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.</p>
  <h2>Why</h2>
  <p>Defining a boundary between public and restricted content helps establish the check points where access will be allowed to the restricted content.</p>
  <h2>When</h2>
  <p>If your application has access control that restricts certain users to specific resources, then define a boundary between those resources. For instance, anonymous users are restricted to one part of the application, while authenticated users can access both
 parts.</p>
  <h2>How</h2>
  <p>Defining the boundary requires:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Determine roles. </strong>Define the various types of users and their rights. Build a security policy for the restricted content and base the user groups' privileges around it.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define the boundary. </strong>Structure the content according to access authorization and logical requirements. Try to use a modular approach when establishing the boundary.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Separate on disk. </strong>Once the boundaries have been established, reflect these boundaries onto the local file system. Separate the restricted content from the public content on disk.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set proper permissions. </strong>Set proper permissions on the restricted content. Dedicate a special directory for the restricted content and require valid authorization before allowing access to the content within this directory. These permissions
 can be enforced at the application, server and operating system levels, depending on the environment in use.</p>

  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Encode user input displayed on pages.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Encode user input that is displayed on web pages to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Applications should never echo untrusted or user modifiable data back to the user without appropriate encoding. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If you write output that includes user input or data from a shared database or a local file that you do not trust, encode it. Encoding the data ensures that it is treated as literal text and not as script. Use the following guidelines to encode user input:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Do not rely on HtmlEncode.</strong>&amp;nbsp;ASP.NET's Server.HtmlEncode function is often used to protect against cross-site scripting attacks. However, this function only encodes &lt;&gt;"&amp; characters. This is not sufficient to protect against all possible attacks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Encode all special characters.</strong> The safest solution is to encode all non-alphanumeric characters. Only this type of whitelist solution will catch all possible XSS attacks, regardless of context.&amp;nbsp; This&amp;nbsp;requires more overhead in terms of processing time and size of the resulting HTML, but it is the safest encoding mechanism for all HTML contexts:</p>
      <pre>public static string HtmlEncode(string x)<br />{<br />   if (x == null)<br />   {<br />   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;return x;<br />   }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;return Regex.Replace(x, "^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$",<br />    new MatchEvaluator(WebUtility.EncodeMatch));<br />}</pre>
    </li>

      <p />
      <strong>Use the Microsoft Anti-XSS Library.</strong> If you are using the Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library, you can use the <em>Microsoft.Security.Application.AntiXss.HtmlEncode</em> method.&amp;nbsp;Similarly, if you write URLs that might contain unsafe characters because they have been constructed from input data or data from a shared database, use <em>Microsoft.Security.Application.AntiXss.UrlEncode</em> to make them safe. <p><b>Note: </b>Make sure that you encode data at the last possible opportunity before the data is returned to the client.&amp;nbsp;If you encode any earlier than this, you may not know the exact context that the data will be used in, and hence the format you need to encode into. Also, early encoding of some data can result in double encoding problems.</p></li>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Do not pass user input or any other external untrusted input to a printf statement or any other statement that takes a format string.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>C and C++ use string functions, like printf(), that allow users to pass a format for the input string. Attackers can manipulate the input parameters passed to these functions to make the function work differently. Attackers can use format string bugs to overwrite parts of the stack, corrupt memory, and crash the system. They can use this vulnerability to execute different kind of attacks such as elevation of privileges, authentication bypass, information disclosure, and denial of services.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Guard against format string problems whenever a dangerous string manipulation function is used (see list below) or any other function that accepts a format string. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Do not allow user data to pass directly to a vulnerable function. This is especially dangerous if your code does not already define the format of the string since the attacker then has free reign add format characters to their input that can be used to directly read or manipulate memory. The following Win32 APIs accept format strings and can be vulnerable to format string attacks:</p>
  <li>printf </li>
  <li>wprintf </li>
  <li>sprintf </li>
  <li>swprintf </li>
  <li>fprintf </li>
  <li>fwprintf </li>
  <li>vprintf </li>
  <li>scanf </li>
  <li>fscanf </li>
  <li>sscanf </li>
  <li>fwscanf </li>
  <li>wscanf </li>
  <li>swscanf </li>
  <li>snprintf<p>The following functions can be used as safer alternatives:</p></li>
  <li>StringCbPrintf </li>
  <li>StringCbPrintfEx </li>
  <li>StringCchPrintf&amp;nbsp;<h1>Problem Example</h1><p>The following code demonstrates the simplest example of a format string vulnerability. In this case an attacker could add their own format characters such as %n or %s to attack your application.</p><pre>int func (char * buffer)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; printf(buffer);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return 0;<br />}</pre><p>In the following example an attacker could input a formatted string such as&amp;nbsp;"%.30dAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" to cause a&amp;nbsp;buffer overflow in the code.</p><pre>void func(char * input) <br />{&amp;nbsp;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;char&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; buffer[16];<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; char&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; message[16];<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sprintf (buffer, "Name: %.8s", input);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sprintf (message, buffer);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; printf(message);&amp;nbsp;<br />}&amp;nbsp;</pre><h1>Solution Example</h1><p>You should not pass user input to a printf function, however if it is necessary ensure that your code is supplying the format string instead of the user input. In the following code, the printf statement uses %s so that the input is interpreted as a string.</p><pre>int func (char * buffer)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; printf("%s", buffer);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return 0;<br />}</pre></li>]]></Data>

  <ul>
    <li>JAVA </li>
    <li>Struts 2</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>Perform input validation using Struts 2 within an application.</p>
  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <p>Strong input validation is a powerful control that can prevent various security issues within an application. This article will describe how to use the built-in mechanisms provided by Struts 2 to perform appropriate input validation.</p>
  <h1>Code Examples</h1>
  <p>There are 2 basic ways to perform input validation within Struts1: manually within an action or using the validator mechanism. (There is an annotations validation mechanism, but that has been deprecated and will not be supported in the future, and thus is not discussed further here.)</p>
  <p>No matter which mechanism you choose, you'll want to make sure validation is enabled at the struts framework level. In order to do that, you'll want to make sure the interceptor stack that is configured to handle requests includes both the "validation" and "workflow" interceptors. These are enabled by default in the <em>struts-default</em> interceptor stack, but if you customize your stack, you'll want to ensure you include them. An example snippet from a custom interceptor stack is below.</p>
  <pre>&lt;interceptor-stack name="myCustomStack"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ... // all other interceptors<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;interceptor-ref name="validation"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;param name="excludeMethods"&gt;input,back,cancel,browse&lt;/param&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/interceptor-ref&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;interceptor-ref name="workflow"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;param name="excludeMethods"&gt;input,back,cancel,browse&lt;/param&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/interceptor-ref&gt;<br />&lt;/interceptor-stack&gt;</pre>
  <h3>
    <br />1. Manual validation overriding the validate() method.</h3>
  <p>If you extend the <em>ActionSupport</em> class for your actions, you can simply override the validate method within your class and have the framework call this method in order to perform validation. Below is an example of a simple validation regarding the login action.</p>
  <pre>public class LoginAction extends ActionSupport {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; public void validate() {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (getUserName().length() == 0) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; addFieldError("userName", "User Name is required");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (getPassword().length() == 0) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; addFieldError("password", "Password is required");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />}</pre>
  <h3>2. Using the validator framework.</h3>
  <p>Using the Struts validator framework involves using additional files. There is 1 file (<em>validators.xml</em>) that is included once for the entire application, then a set of action specific files, generally one per action (or one per action/alias). These files have the naming convention <em>ActionName-validation.xml</em> (ex. <em>LoginAction-validation.xml</em>) </p>
  <p>Since the <em>validators.xml</em> file covers many standard validations, to get started you'll only need to create action specific configuration files to specify the types of validations you want for your given action. An exmaple for the login action is given below.</p>
  <pre>&lt;validators&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;field name="uname"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;field-validator type="required"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;message&gt;You must enter a value for user name.&lt;/message&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/field-validator&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/field&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;field name="pw"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;field-validator type="required"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;message&gt;You must enter a value for password.&lt;/message&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/field-validator&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/field&gt;<br />&lt;/validators&gt;</pre>
  <p>Now that the validations are in place, you should have an associated action class, JSP and Struts configuration configured. </p>
  <p>A sample action class is below:</p>
  <pre>public class QuizAction extends ActionSupport {</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; private String uname;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; private String pw;</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; public String getUName() {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return uname;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; public void setUName(String uname) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; this.uname = uname;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; public String getPw() {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return pw;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; public void setPw(String pw) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; this.pw = pw;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />}</pre>
  <p>The JSP might include a form that looks something like this:</p>
  <pre>&lt;s:form method="post"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;s:textfield label="User Name: " name="uname"/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;s:textfield label="Password: " name="pw"/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;s:submit/&gt;<br />&lt;/s:form&gt;</pre>
  <p>Finally, the associated Struts configuration might look like this: </p>
  <pre>&lt;action name="HelloWorld" class="tutorial.HelloWorld"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;result name="success"&gt;/home.jsp&lt;/result&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;result name="error"&gt;/error.jsp&lt;/result&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;result name="input"&gt;/login.jsp&lt;/result&gt;<br />&lt;/action&gt;</pre>
  <p>It's important to note that the input result should be included, since that is where the user will be routed in the case that the validation fails. This should be the same location that triggered the validation. For example, from our <em>login.jsp</em> the user is routed to the action, the validation fails, and then the user is re-routed back to the same<em> login.jsp</em> so there is a smooth experience for the user.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, input validation can function as a strong security control if used properly and applied thoroughly throughout the application. The Struts 2 framework provides 2 options for accomplishing this task. </p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use per-user or per-session indirect object references.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Indirect object references are an effective method for limiting users to accessing resources for which they are explicitly authorized whenever the application lets the user choose what objects to access. Using direct object references may expose sensitive data to attackers. Direct object references often expose sensitive data, such as files, database entries, or personal information. Direct object reference attacks are very simple to execute and have been used in high profile, low-skill attacks. Indirect object references should be used to prevent direct object reference vulnerabilities.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Indirect object references should be used when presenting the user with a choice of what object(s) to access.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To use indirect object references:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify pages that use direct object references.</strong> Make a list of all pages in the application. Go through the list and identify all pages that use direct object references by examining each page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify objects that are being referenced.</strong> For each page that uses direct object references, make a list of all objects that are being referenced.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Consider alternatives.</strong> Using indirect object references may require significant changes to the application. Please, consider not using object references at all or performing access control checks each time an object is referenced. Not using object references means replacing all code that performs object references. Performing access control checks means adding code that performs access control checks to code that performs object references.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define object reference maps.</strong> Object reference maps are arrays or hashes of objects that are being referenced. The web application exposes the index of the array or the key of the hash that matches the required resource, rather than exposing the object itself. This approach ensures that only objects in the array may be accessed. For this approach to work, reference maps should only include objects for which access is authorized. It is possible to use per-user or per-session object mappings. Per-user mappings define objects that may be accessed by each user. Per-session mappings define objects that may be accessed by each user for the current session. Per-session references may offer additional security or flexibility, but require more work. Mappings should be generated dynamically and that means that code has to be written that defines objects that may be accessed by each user. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use reference maps instead of direct object references.</strong> Once the code that defines object reference maps is written, all the pages that reference objects have to be updated to use the reference maps.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>Insecure direct object reference vulnerabilities are best explained with an example. Consider a social networking web site that allows a user to view the contact information of his friends. The contact information is stored in a database. For the purposes of this example, let's consider that the user has friends with the following contact information:</p>
  <pre>UID: 1234234513; NAME: Joe; EMAIL: joe@yahoo.com;<br />UID: 1234123412; NAME: Brad; EMAIL: brad@gmail.com;<br />UID: 4244324332; NAME: Jack; EMAIL: jack@hotmail.com;</pre>
  <p />The database also has users that are not friends of the user, such as: <pre>UID: 43243544434; Name: Jill; EMAIL: jill@home.com;</pre><p />The web site can then provide links to the user to view the contact information of his friends, such as: <pre>http://socialnet.com/viewprofile.php?id=1234234513<br />http://socialnet.com/viewprofile.php?id=1234123412<br />http://socialnet.com/viewprofile.php?id=4244324332</pre><p>After viewing the web page source and discovering the vulnerability, the user can access Jill's contact information by going to http://socialnet.com/viewprofile.php?id=43243544434</p><p>The user probably won't know Jill's UID in the database, but can write a simple script that downloads contact information for all valid UIDs and then use it as he sees fit. This might not sound very serious in this example, but it is a lot more serious for things like banking applications that display account or transaction information.</p><h1>Solution Example</h1><p>Indirect object references are best explained with an example. Consider a social networking web site that allows a user to view the contact information of his friends. The contact information is stored in a database. For the purposes of this example, let's consider that the user has friends with the following contact information:</p><pre>UID: 1234234513; NAME: Joe; EMAIL: joe@yahoo.com;<br />UID: 1234123412; NAME: Brad; EMAIL: brad@gmail.com;<br />UID: 4244324332; NAME: Jack; EMAIL: jack@hotmail.com;</pre><p />The database also has users that are not friends of the user, such as: <pre>UID: 43243544434; Name: Jill; EMAIL: jill@home.com;</pre><p>The web site should create a reference table programmatically before displaying options to the user. The reference table should not be available to the user, it should be used entirely on the back-end. The reference table can look something like the following:</p><pre>1 -&gt; 1234234513<br />2 -&gt; 1234123412<br />3 -&gt; 4244324332</pre><p />The web site can then provide links to the user to view the contact information of his friends, such as: <pre>http://socialnet.com/viewprofile.php?id=1<br />http://socialnet.com/viewprofile.php?id=2<br />http://socialnet.com/viewprofile.php?id=3</pre><p>Note, that because the links use reference numbers, instead of database keys, the user can only view the authorized information. Trying to view Jill's profile by using the URL http://socialnet.com/viewprofile.php?id=43243544434 is not going to work, because that id is not in the reference table. Thus, reference tables a.k.a. indirect object references are effective at limiting user access to application data, especially in databases.</p><h1>Additional Resources</h1><ul><li>For more information about defending from Insecure Direct Object References, please see <a href="http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netsecur/article.php/10952_3927401_1/Protect-Your-Web-Apps-From-Insecure-Direct-Object-References.htm">http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netsecur/article.php/10952_3927401_1/Protect-Your-Web-Apps-From-Insecure-Direct-Object-References.htm</a></li><li>For an example of an implementation of an access reference map, please see <a href="http://owasp-esapi-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk_doc/latest/org/owasp/esapi/AccessReferenceMap.html">http://owasp-esapi-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk_doc/latest/org/owasp/esapi/AccessReferenceMap.html</a></li></ul>]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Force the user to re-authenticate when executing security-critical functionality including, but not limited to, change of password, account modifications and critical transactions.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Forcing the user to re-authenticate verifies the user's decision to execute the given functionality and preserves the application's integrity in the event that a user's account has been compromised via session hijacking.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Follow these steps when forcing re-authentication:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify critical functionality.</strong> Evaluate your application's design and requirements and determine what parts and resources of your application are very important to your organization's business model or your application's security architecture. This could include activities such as financial transactions or resetting user passwords.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Adopt a re-authentication mechanism.</strong> Establish a mechanism that requires the user to verify their authenticity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Current password.</strong> The user uses their current password to confirm the identity. This technique ensures that the given user is aware of the action to be performed and holds responsibility for executing it. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>CAPTCHA.</strong> CAPTCHA are mechanisms designed to ensure that a human, not an automated script, is using the system. Using a CAPTCHA should be seen as a way of augmenting a password in this kind of situation, not a way of replacing it. Many CAPTCHA systems embed distorted letters or numbers into displayed images which the user must enter. There are a number of problems with many CAPTCHA systems, so they should not be relied on too heavily. First, many graphical CAPTCHAs can be trivially broken by optical character recognition systems, and ensuring that a CAPTCHA is sufficiently strong to be useful without having too high of a failure rate for real users is difficult. If CAPTCHAs are reused, the attacker can simply record the session IDs of CAPTCHAs with known values and replay them. CAPTCHAs can also be broken by using a man-in-the-middle technique where the image is saved and forwarded to another site controlled by the attacker. An unsuspecting user of that site solves the CAPTCHA and the attacker forwards the answer to the victim site. CAPTCHAs also create accessibility problems for users, as blind and sometimes even color-blind individuals can find them impossible. If you choose to implement a CAPTCHA, be aware of the trade-offs involved and ensure that the system you use is appropriately protected against the attacks you expect to see. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>2nd Factor.</strong> If your application supports a second factor of authentication such as a token, this could play a role in the re-authentication scheme.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enforce the re-authentication mechanism.</strong> Once the critical functionality is identified and the re-authentication mechanism is established, enforce the re-authentication mechanism before all security-critical actions.</p>
    </li>

A SQL injection attack exploits vulnerabilities in input validation to run arbitrary commands in the database. It can occur when your application uses input to construct dynamic SQL statements to access the database. It can also occur if your code uses stored procedures that are passed strings that contain raw user input. Using the SQL injection attack, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands in your database, with all the privileges granted to the process being attacked. The issue is magnified if the application uses an over-privileged account to connect to the database. In this instance it is possible to use the database server to run operating system commands and potentially compromise other servers, in addition to being able to retrieve, manipulate, and destroy data.

  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>Perform input validation using Struts 1 within an application.</p>
  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <p>Strong input validation is a powerful control that can prevent various security issues within an application. This article will describe how to use the built-in mechanisms provided by Struts 1 to perform appropriate input validation.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>There are 2 basic ways to perform input validation within Struts1: overriding the <em>validate()</em> method in the form bean and using the validator mechanism.</p>
  <h3>1. Overriding the validate() method.</h3>
  <p>If you use the <em>ActionForm</em> class (or some subclass) to handle your user input, you can simply override the validate method within your class and have the framework call this method in order to perform validation. Below is an example of a simple form bean</p>
  <pre>public class MyForm extends ActionForm {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; private String title;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; public ActionErrors validate(ActionMapping mapping, HttpServletRequest request) { <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; //very important - call super first before any validations<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ActionErrors errors = super.validate(mapping,request);&amp;nbsp; </pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (errors == null) errors = new ActionErrors();<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (title == null) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; //"errors.required" message is defined in message bundle for app<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; errors.add(ActionErrors.GLOBAL_ERROR, new ActionError("errors.required","Title"));<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if (errors.empty()) return null;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return errors;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />}</pre>
  <p>The next step is to define the form bean as is typical for the application in the <em>struts-config.xml</em> file.</p>
  <pre>&lt;form-bean name="myForm" type="com.myapp.struts.form.MyForm" /&gt;</pre>
  <p>Finally (also in the <em>struts-config.xml</em> file) you need to define your action, and tell struts that validation should be enabled. This will cause the framework to validate your form when the action is submitted.</p>
  <pre>&lt;action path="..." name="myForm" validate="true" ... /&gt;</pre>
  <h3>2. Using the validator framework.</h3>
  <p>Using the Struts validator framework involves including 2 additional files, the <em>validator-rules.xml</em> (the actual validations, many defaults provided for you) and <em>validation.xml</em> (ties validations to application forms) files.</p>
  <p>You'll also need to tweak the <em>struts-config.xml</em> file by adding the configuration shown below:</p>
  <pre>&lt;!--&amp;nbsp; Validator plugin --&gt;<br />&lt;plug-in className="org.apache.struts.validator.ValidatorPlugIn"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;set-property<br />&amp;nbsp; property="pathnames"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; value="/WEB-INF/validator-rules.xml,/WEB-INF/validation.xml"/&gt;<br />&lt;/plug-in&gt;</pre>
  <p>You'll likely want to use the <em>DynaValidatorForm</em> or some subclass since it is very convenient to use when working with the validation framework. An example login form configured this way is shown here: </p>
  <pre>&lt;form-beans&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form-bean name="LoginForm" type="org.apache.struts.validator.DynaValidatorForm"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form-property name="userName" type="java.lang.String" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form-property name="password" type="java.lang.String" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form-bean&gt;<br />&lt;/form-beans&gt;</pre>
  <p>Since the <em>validator-rules.xml</em> file covers many standard validations, you'll essentially need to alter the <em>validation.xml</em> file to account for your new form validations. Below is an example covering the login form.</p>
  <pre>&lt;form-validation&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;formset&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;form name="LoginForm"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;field property="userName" depends="required"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;arg key="LoginForm.userName"/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/field&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;field property="password" depends="required,minlength"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;arg0 key="LoginForm.password"/&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;arg1 key="${var:minlength}" name="minlength" resource="false"/&gt;</pre>
  <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;var&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;var-name&gt;minlength&lt;/var-name&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;var-value&gt;6&lt;/var-value&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/var&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/field&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/form&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/formset&gt;<br />&lt;/form-validation&gt;</pre>
  <p>Now that these pieces are in place, you configure your standard action as shown below and ensure validation is enabled in order to perform validation. </p>
  <pre>&lt;action path="..." name="LoginForm" validate="true" ... /&gt;</pre>
  <p>Whether you choose to validate using the code-driven validate method or the configuration-driven validator framework, you can display errors to the user on the UI using the <em>ActionError</em> or <em>ActionErrors</em> tags provided by Struts. This will allow you to display the error messages directly to the user in a localized manner. </p>
  <p>In conclusion, input validation can function as a strong security control if used properly and applied thoroughly throughout the application. The Struts framework provides 2 options for accomplishing this task. </p>

  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <p>Strong input validation is a powerful control that can prevent various security issues within an application. This article will describe how to use the built-in mechanisms provided by JSF to perform appropriate input validation.</p>
  <h1>Solution Examples</h1>
  <p>There are several ways to perform input validation using JSF depending on the needed validation. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Using the required attribute on form elements.</strong> For most form elements in JSF, you can simply add the <em>required="true"</em> attribute to ensure that the field has a value when submitted. This is a trivial, but very common, validation and is easy to handle in JSF.</p>
      <pre>&lt;h:inputText value="#{myBean.someField}" required="true"/&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use built-in validators.</strong> This mechanism allows you to add validation directly within the field of the form you are validating using any of the many built-in validators. </p>
      <pre>&lt;h:inputText value="#{myBean.someField}" required="true"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;f:validateLength minimum="6" maximum="50"/&gt;<br />&lt;/h:inputText&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use custom method from backing bean to perform validation.</strong> This option simply provides you with a mechanism to build out a method that checks the given field and throw a <em>ValidatorException</em> if necessary. This is completely custom code, but JSF does provide a hook to access custom validation methods by using the validator attribute as shown below.</p>
      <pre>&lt;h:inputText value="#{myBean.myField}" validator="#{myBean.validateMyField}" /&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Build a custom validator by implementing <em>Validator</em> interface.</strong> If you have a validation that could be reusable but does not exist in the standard validations, a custom validator is likely the best option given it's reuse potential. First, you need to build out the validation by creating a class that implements the <em>Validator</em> interface and throws a <em>ValidationException</em> when necessary.</p>
      <pre>javax.faces.validator.Validator<br />....<br />public class MyFieldValidator implements Validator {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; public void validate(FacesContext context, UIComponent component, Object value)<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;throws ValidatorException {</pre>
      <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; String myField = (String) value;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if(!myField.contains("%")) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; FacesMessage message = new FacesMessage();<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; message.setSeverity(FacesMessage.SEVERITY_ERROR);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; message.setSummary("Invalid format.");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; message.setDetail("You can't use wildcarding here.");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; context.addMessage("myForm:MyField", message);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; throw new ValidatorException(message);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />}</pre>
      <p>In order to use a custom validator, you simply register it with JSF by adding something like the below snippet to the <em>faces-config.xml</em> file.</p>
      <pre>&lt;validator&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;validator-id&gt;myFieldValidator&lt;/validator-id&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;validator-class&gt;com.myapp.MyFieldValidator&lt;/validator-class&gt;<br />&lt;/validator&gt;</pre>
      <p>Finally, you would add the validator to a given field in a form similar to how you would use one of the built-in validators.</p>
      <pre>&lt;h:inputText id="MyField" value="#{myBean.myField}"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;f:validator validatorId="myFieldValidator" /&gt;<br />&lt;/h:inputText&gt;</pre>
      <p>For any of the validation mechanisms listed above, there is a common UI pattern for displaying the error messages back to the user. You can use the <em>h:messages</em> or <em>h:message</em> tag</p>
      <pre>//for displaying all messages<br />&lt;h:messages /&gt;</pre>
      <pre>//for displaying messages for a single input field<br />&lt;h:message for="userName" /&gt;</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>In conclusion, input validation can function as a strong security control if used properly and applied thoroughly throughout the application. The JSF framework provides several options for accomplishing this task.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Check your array indexes before use to ensure that the index is within the array bounds.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Array indexing errors, such as buffer overruns can lead to memory being overwritten at arbitrary locations. This can lead to application instability or, with a carefully constructed attack, can lead to code injection.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Whenever indexing into an array with a variable or calculated value.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Make sure that the following rules are followed: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure that indexes run from zero to n-1, where n is the number of array elements. </li>
    <li>Where possible, make sure that code does not use input parameters as array indexes. </li>
    <li>Make sure that any input parameters used as array indexes are validated and constrained to ensure that the maximum and minimum array bounds cannot be exceeded. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>In the following code the array is indexed without checking to ensure the index is within the array boundaries.</p>
  <pre>int ArrayIndexing(int index)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; return intArray[index];<br />}</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>In the following code the array index is checked before use.</p>
  <pre>int ArrayIndexing(int index)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; if ((index &gt;= 0) || (index &lt; CLOUD_REG_NUM_PROV_IFCS))<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp; 	return -1;<br />  }<br />  return intArray[index];<br />}</pre>]]></Data>

  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Configure Apache to use only strong SSL algorithms.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using strong encryption algorithms with SSL helps reduce the risk of successful eavesdropping attacks and helps with regulatory compliance.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To use only strong SSL algorithms, edit the <em>httpd.conf</em> file to include the following settings:</p>
  <pre>SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1<br />SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!SSLv2:!MD5:@STRENGTH<br />SSLHonorCipherOrder on</pre>
  <p>These settings enable only the TLS protocol and only the strong encryption cipher suites.</p>
  <p>It may also be a good idea to include the following line in case of old versions of <em>apache/mod_ssl</em>:</p>
  <pre>SSLInsecureRenegotiation off</pre>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Enforce strong password requirements.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Requiring strong passwords prevents weak passwords from being used. Using strong passwords makes the application more resilient to password guessing attacks.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To enforce strong password requirements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify application requirements.</strong> Determine whether your application needs to have a customizable password complexity policy or if it's okay to hard-code password complexity requirements. Define secure defaults for password complexity options.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify password changing code.</strong> Review your application to find code that is responsible for changing user passwords.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>(Optional) Let the user enter the password twice.</strong> It is a common practice to allow the user to enter the password twice to make sure that the user enters the new password correctly. This is important because the password fields are typically masked, so the user cannot see his input, and changing the password to an unintended one may leave the user locked out of his account. If this is implemented in your application, the password changing code should validate the two entered passwords to make sure they match.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check password length.</strong> Add code to the password changing function to check the password length for minimum and maximum limits defined by policy. For example:</p>
      <pre>if(strlen($password) &lt; 8)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;//password is too short<br />}<p /><p>if(strlen($password) &gt; 20)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;//password is too long<br />}</p></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check the password for numbers.</strong> Add code to the password changing function to check the password for numbers. For example:</p>
      <pre>if(!preg_match("#[0-9]+#", $password))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;//password does not contain numbers<br />}</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Check the password for lower-case letters.</strong> Add code to the password changing function to check the password for lower-case letters. For example: <p /><pre>if(!preg_match("#[a-z]+#", $password))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;//password does not contain lower-case letters<br />}</pre></li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Check the password for capital letters.</strong> Add code to the password changing function to check the password for capital letters. For example: <p /><pre>if(!preg_match("#[A-Z]+#", $password)) <br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;//password does not contain capital letters<br />}</pre></li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>(Optional) Check the password for symbols.</strong> If your application requires it, add code to the password changing function to check the password for symbols. For example: <p /><pre>if(!preg_match("#\W+#", $password))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;//password does not contain symbols<br />}</pre></li>

        <li>Authentication should be implemented on the server-side. </li>
        <li>Authentication controls should be centralized. </li>
        <li>Authentication controls should fail securely. </li>
        <li>Strong authentication credentials (passwords) should be enforced. </li>
        <li>Account management functions should be protected. </li>

        <li>Authentication credentials (passwords) should expire. </li>
        <li>Authentication events should be logged. </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define authentication control APIs.</strong> Make the exposed APIs simple to use for developers. Define authentication APIs to satisfy all application requirements. Include functionality to authenticate with external services.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Be careful when manipulating memory, either through memory copying or array manipulation, so that the data being placed in a buffer does not overwrite the bounds of that buffer.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Buffer overruns are a vulnerability that can be used by an attacker to modify the contents of the stack or the heap. Under the right conditions this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the full privileges of the currently running code and user context.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Whenever manipulating memory or using APIs that manipulate memory.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Make sure that the following rules are followed: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check buffer size. </strong>When copying data into a buffer, check the length of the buffer against the length of data being passed in, to ensure there is enough room. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Append to buffer carefully. </strong>When appending data into a buffer, ensure that the target buffer has enough room to contain the copied data. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check array indices. </strong>When modifying the data in an array, ensure that the array index is within the bounds of the array allocation. Be careful of off by one errors in arrays since 0 based array indexing means that the largest array index will be one less than the allocated size. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Pass maximum length as a parameter. </strong>If you are using a function that copies variable-length data into a buffer and uses a maximum length parameter properly, be sure to pass the correct value into this parameter. Be careful about confusing target length with source length. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Truncate data if necessary.</strong> If you see a problem, make sure the code truncates the data instead of expanding the buffer to fit it. Buffer expansion may just move the problem downstream. Make sure that the code does not rely on another layer or tier for data truncation. </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The application should not contain code similar to the following example. </p>
  <pre>public void ProcessInput()<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;char[] data = new char[255];&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;GetData(data);<br />}</pre>
  <pre>public void GetData(char[] buffer)<br />{<br />int ch = 0;<br />fixed (char* pBuf = buffer)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; do<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ch = System.Console.Read();<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *(pBuf++) = (char)ch;<br />&amp;nbsp; } while(ch != '\n');<br />}<br />} </pre>
  <p>In this code example, an overflow occurs whenever a single line is more than 255 characters long. There are two problems in this code: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <b>ProcessInput</b> function allocates only enough space for 255 characters. </li>
    <li>The <b>GetData</b> function does not check the size of the array as it fills it. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>In the following code, the <strong>GetData</strong>&amp;nbsp;function checks the size of the array before filling it.</p>
  <pre>public void ProcessInput()<br />{<br /><br /> char[] data = new char[ARRAY_SIZE];&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;GetData(data, ARRAY_SIZE);<br />}</pre>
  <pre>public void GetData(char[] buffer, int bufferSize)<br />{<br />int ch = 0;<br />bool done = false;<br />fixed (char* pBuf = buffer)<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; for (int i = 0; i &lt; bufferSize &amp;&amp; !done; i++)<br />&amp;nbsp; {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ch = System.Console.Read();<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *(pBuf++) = (char)ch;<br />    if ('\n' == ch)<br />    {<br /> 	done = true;<br />    }<br />&amp;nbsp; } <br />}<br />} </pre>]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or
 by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>It is easy to modify the behavior of the client or just write a new client that does not observe the same data validation rules.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All applications should only use server-side validation when the code relies on security.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Server-side code should perform its own validation. What if an attacker bypasses your client, or shuts off your client-side script routines, for example, by disabling JavaScript? Use client-side validation to help reduce the number of round trips to the
 server but do not rely on it for security. This is an example of defense in depth.</p>

  <p>Whereever possible, avoid implementing custom authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These may make it easier to provide a clear separation between
 authentication tasks and authorization tasks. In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these
 routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly. Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. For example, consider
 using libraries with authentication capabilities such as <em>OpenSSL</em> or the ESAPI

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Force users to renew their passwords after a given period of time.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Forcing users to renew their passwords reduces the risk of valid credentials becoming exposed. While this technique can prevent attackers from obtaining the valid credentials through the use of a Brute Force Attack or a Dictionary Attack, it can also reduce the business risk associated with any instances of discovered or leaked valid credentials.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Your application should always force its users to change their passwords.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to force users to change their passwords:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define a password change policy. </strong>Establish a maximum password age for your application's users. For example, require that users must change passwords every 60 days and privileged users must change passwords every 30 days. PCI DSS requirements state that a user's password must be renewed at most every 90 days and that the new password cannot be the same as the previous four.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Design a password change mechanism.</strong> Track the password age and prompt the user to change their password when the password expires. For example, the following SQL transaction will help the application to determine whether a user's password has expired:</p>
      <pre>select * from passHistory<br />where userid = {{username}} and<br />last_changed &lt; (current_timestamp - interval '30' day);</pre>

Set the //Secure// and //HTTPOnly// flags on all sensitive cookies, including session cookies.

==Why==

Set the //Secure// flag on all sensitive cookies to protect the contents of the sensitive cookies from eavesdropping attacks. Setting the //Secure// flag on sensitive cookies ensures they are only transferred over connections that are secured by SSL. 

Set the //HTTPOnly// flag on sensitive cookies to prevent the contents of those cookies from being access by Cross-Site Scripting exploits. The //HTTPOnly// flag prevents the contents of the marked cookie from being accessed by client-side script.

==How==

To set the //Secure// and //HTTPOnly// flags on all sensitive cookies:

# **Verify that SSL is available.** The //Secure// flag forces cookies to be sent over SSL. SSL has to be available for this to work.
# **Identify sensitive cookies.** Session cookies should always be considered sensitive. Enumerate all cookies used by the application. Make a list of cookies that may contain sensitive information.
# **Identify code that creates sensitive cookies.** For each sensitive cookie in the list, find the code that creates that cookie.
# **Set the //Secure// and //HTTPOnly// flags for each sensitive cookie.** For each piece of code that creates a sensitive cookie, add code that sets the //Secure// and //HTTPOnly// flags for the cookie. Make sure, that when the //Secure// attribute is set for a cookie, it is in response to a request that was made over HTTPS and not HTTP.
# **Configure the platform.** Many platform have configuration options that allow setting the //Secure// and //HTTPOnly// flags for session cookies. Please refer to your platform's documentation for information about whether this functionality is available and how to use it.]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use <i>sizeof()</i> to determine sizes of objects instead of using hardcoded values.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Different platforms may represent the same data structures differently in memory. Using hardcoded values for object memory sizes may result in errors when performing memory management operations.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Search code for hardcoded memory sizes. If found, replace hardcoded values with run-time calls to <i>sizeof() </i>to measure sizes of objects in memory. </p>
  <p>Avoid using <i>sizeof()</i> to calculate sizes of arrays. When an array is passed to a function as a parameter, it is passed as a pointer. If that function then calls <i>sizeof()</i> using that pointer as an argument, <i>sizeof()</i> will return the size of the pointer, not the size of the array. To get the amount of memory used by an array or a string correctly, use <i>sizeof()</i> in the same scope in which the array or string is declared. Store the memory size of an array or a string as a variable and pass it as an argument to other functions when it is necessary to know the size of the array or string outside of the scope where it is declared.</p>

    <Content Sanitized="false" DataType="html">
      <Data><![CDATA[<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into
 something that does. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be
 rejected outright.</p>
  <h2>Why</h2>
  <p>Input that is not validated can lead to cross-site scripting, SQL injection, directory traversals, and other vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or otherwise compromise an application.</p>
  <p>While input validation can be used to remediate the majority of known security vulnerabilities, it should not be used as the only line of defense, as there are vulnerabilities which input validation is not effective at remediating.</p>
  <h2>How</h2>
  <p>To validate all input:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sources of input.</strong> Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request
 headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls. Many file inclusion problems occur because the programmer assumed
 that certain inputs could not be modified, especially for cookies and URL components.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Validate all relevant input properties. </strong>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across
 related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if you are expecting colors such as "red" or "blue."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use whitelist input validation.</strong> When dynamically constructing web pages, use stringent whitelists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. All input should be validated and cleansed, not just
 parameters that the user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected
 to be redisplayed by the site. It is common to see data from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer.
 Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended. Ensure that you perform input validation at well-defined interfaces within the application. This will help protect the application even if a component is reused or moved elsewhere.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use whitelists for filename validation.</strong> When validating filenames, use stringent whitelists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single "." character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude
 directory separators such as "/" to avoid CWE-36. Use a whitelist of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434. Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a blacklist,
 which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering "/" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of "\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces
 dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if "../" sequences are removed from the ".../...//" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of "../" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the "../" string.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Allow only safe file extensions.</strong> Define a very limited set of allowable extensions and only generate filenames that end in these extensions. Consider the possibility of XSS (CWE-79) before you allow .html or .htm file types. Ensure that
 only one extension is used in the filename. Some web servers, including some versions of Apache, may process files based on inner extensions so that "filename.php.gif" is fed to the PHP interpreter. When running on a web server that supports case-insensitive
 filenames, ensure that you perform case-insensitive evaluations of the extensions that are provided.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use whitelist input validation for OS command execution.</strong> When constructing OS command strings, use stringent whitelists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. Use runtime policy enforcement
 to create a whitelist of allowable commands, then prevent use of any command that does not appear in the whitelist. Technologies such as AppArmor are available to do this.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[==What to Do==

Validate all user input by using white-list/positive input validation. White-list input validation means allowing only input that is explicitly defined as valid, as opposed to black-list input validation, which filters out known bad input.

==Why==

Properly implemented input validation is effective at preventing SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

==How==

To validate all user input using white-list input validation:

# **Identify all entry points for user input.** Make a list of all possible sources of user input in your application, such as form fields, POST/GET parameters, cookies, etc.
# **Identify all types on input accepted by the application.** For each source of user input on the list, define valid characters, length, format, and range (for numerical values).
# **Define an input validation subsystem.** Define a set of validator functions that should be used to validate each type of input handled by the application. Input should be validated on the server.
# **Validate characters.** Restrict the acceptable range of characters in text input by using regular expressions.
# **Validate length.** Add code to check that the length of the user input is valid.
# **Validate format.** If the input type has a specific pattern, such as a date or a phone number, add code to use regular expressions to make sure user input matches the input type specified by the application. Use regular expressions to enforce strong password requirements.
# **Validate range.** Restrict the acceptable range of numerical input by comparing the input to the maximum and minimum acceptable values.
# **(Optional) Reject and respond to known bad input.** This step does not add much actual security, but it is included here to let you know that such an option exists. The input validation subsystem may check for known attack strings and respond to these likely attacks by doing things like logging detailed user information, alerting the administrator, blocking the user's IP address for some time, and displaying an error message to the attacker informing that you are onto him and reminding him of the consequences.
# **(Optional) Encode input.** If the input is going to be displayed back through the web application, consider adding code to encode it to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks.]]></Data>

Include unique tokens in HTTP requests when performing sensitive operations to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

==Why==

CSRF may be possible when an attacker can form a URL, which performs an action on the behalf of an authenticated user. Forming such URLs becomes much more difficult, if unique tokens are included in HTTP requests.

==How==

To include unique tokens in HTTP requests:

# **Identify sensitive operations.** Review application design and code to identify all operations that require authorization.
# **Identify code that performs sensitive operations.** Identify all pages that are involved in performing sensitive operations - this includes both the pages that link to sensitive operations and the code that actually carries out the sensitive operations.
# **Choose a method for generating unique tokens.** There are different ways to generate unique tokens. One approach is to generate random tokens for each request. Another approach is to use an API designed specifically for mitigating CSRF, such as ESAPI. Do not use session IDs as anti-CSRF tokens.
# **Add unique tokens to HTTP requests.** Add code that uses the chosen method of generating unique tokens. Add code that adds the generated unique tokens to the pages that link to sensitive operations in hidden fields.
# **Add token validation code.** Add code to the pages that carry out sensitive operations that validates the unique tokens to make sure that they have been generated on the server-side.]]></Data>

  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>Implementing protections that prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) within an application that uses ESAPI.</p>
  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <p>CSRF is a powerful attack that allows an attacker to force a victim to execute functionality within an application on behalf of the attacker. The example below gives an example of how to prevent CSRF within an application that uses ESAPI.</p>
  <h1>Scenarios</h1>
  <p>CSRF is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious web site causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated, causing the victim to perform activities on behalf of the attacker. In order to prevent CSRF, the most common effective solution currently used is the synchronizer token pattern. The flow below shows the basic steps in prevention. </p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>To add unique tokens to HTTP requests using ESAPI: <ol><li><p><strong>Store a randomly generated token for each authenticated user.</strong> Upon successful authentication of a user, store a randomly generated (using a secure pseudo-random number generator such as <em>java.security.SecureRandom</em>) string (token) in the <em>HttpSession</em> for the user.</p><p>The code below is in the <em>DefaultUser</em> class in ESAPI.

      <Data><![CDATA[==What to Do==

Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience, and nobody else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic and not being cryptic enough. They should not necessarily reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Such detailed information can be used to refine the original attack to increase the chances of success.

If errors must be tracked in some detail, capture them in log messages - but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Avoid recording highly sensitive information such as passwords in any form.

==Why==

In the context of path traversal, error messages which disclose path information can help attackers craft the appropriate attack strings to move through the file system hierarchy.

In the context of OS Command Injection, error information passed back to the user might reveal whether an OS command is being executed and possibly which command is being used.

In the context of SQL Injection, error messages revealing the structure of a SQL query can help attackers tailor successful attack strings.

==How==

Perform the following actions to prevent disclosure of sensitive information in error messages:

# **Identify error messages.** Review error handling code and find all instances of error messages being presented to the user, including errors displayed by the framework.
# **Write simple error messages.** Write simple messages and warnings explaining the error to the user but don't include any of the following sensitive information: 
## **File locations.** Filesystem information, such as the locations of Operating System files, databases, or other sensitive information may be used by an attacker to coordinate his attacks, so this information should not be included in error messages.
## **System information.** System information, such as Operating System version, network names, internal network addresses, etc should not be included in error messages because it may help an attacker identify vulnerable software, choose exploits, or attack other systems on the network.
## **User account information.** Information such as usernames, personal names, e-mail addresses, or other user information should not be revealed in error messages, because it may help an attacker attack that user account.
## **Secrets.** It goes without saying that secret information, such as passwords, password hashes, cardholder data, etc should not be disclosed in error messages.
# **Use simple error messages.** Rewrite code that displays verbose error messages that display sensitive information to the user to display new, simple error messages.]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[==What to Do==

When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs. For example, ID 1 could map to //inbox.txt// and ID 2 could map to //profile.txt//. Features such as the //ESAPI AccessReferenceMap// provide this capability.

==Why==

Using reference maps helps make sure that only valid input is handled by the application. Reference maps are one of the most effective implementations of white-list input validation.

==How==

To use reference maps:

# **Identify all known acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs.** Make a list of all objects that should be available to the user. This is the critical requirement for using reference maps - if it is too difficult to enumerate valid objects, then reference maps probably should not be used.
# **Assign a unique reference ID to each known acceptable object.** It is common to assign numeric IDs to objects to be used as references. Another common approach is to assign short-hand names to objects, such as pages or filenames.
# **Accept only valid reference IDs.** Add functions that accept only valid reference IDs defined in the previous step for accessing the objects and rejects all other input. This applies only to code that deals with the objects that have reference IDs defined. It may also be prudent to perform authorization checks in these functions.
# **Resolve reference IDs.** Add functions that replace reference IDs with handles to the acceptable objects. It may also be prudent to perform authorization checks in these functions.
# **Use reference IDs.** Replace all code that references the objects directly with code that uses functions that validate and resolve reference IDs.]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[==Description==

A Cross Site Request Forgery attack occurs when an attacker tricks a victim into loading a page that contains a malicious request. This request may be able to change the state of the web application and is possible because the request is sent in the context of the logged in victim. For many sites each request automatically sends the victim's credentials such as the session cookie or authentication credentials. Due to this fact there is no way to distinguish the false request from a legitimate request.

Cross Site Request Forgery attacks are known by other names including XSRF, Session Riding, One-Click and Zero-Click attacks.

A One-Click attack refers to a link that causes a malicious action to be performed when a victim clicks on it. A Zero-Click attack is automatically executed upon page load. A common way to perform a zero-click attack is to embed the request in the source of an image.

  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Protecting session IDs helps protect user sessions from being hijacked.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To protect session IDs:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Store session IDs in cookies.</strong> This is the default behavior in PHP.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Set the "<em>secure</em>" flag on session cookies.</strong> Edit the <em>php.ini</em> file and configure the "<em>session.cookie_secure</em>" setting, like this:</p>
      <pre>session.cookie_secure = On</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>
          <em>Set the "HTTPOnly" flag on session cookies.</em>

      <pre>session.cookie_httponly = On</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Do not disclose session IDs.</strong> Make sure that session IDs are not disclosed in URLs, logs, or error messages. Do not allow URL rewriting of session cookies.</p>

    <Content Sanitized="false" DataType="html">
      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>A buffer overflow occurs when a program tries to copy more data than a buffer can fit, thus overwriting adjacent memory. There are two types of buffer overflows: stack buffer overflows and heap buffer overflows. In the case of stack buffer overflows, a buffer on the stack is being overflowed and adjacent memory on the stack is overwritten - because the stack typically contains processor register values that control program flow, an attacker may use this vulnerability to redirect program flow and execute arbitrary code. Heap buffer overflows are discussed in detail in a separate article.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <p>A stack buffer overflow allows an attacker to crash the program and possibly execute aribitrary code. Stack buffer overflows are some of the most dangerous vulnerabilities - they can often be used to give an attacker full control over a target machine.</p>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <p>Exploiting buffer overflows is difficult, but a successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to execution of arbitrary code on the local machine. If the buffer overflow exists in code that handles input from remote computers, such as network parsing code, the buffer overflow may be exploited by a remote user.</p>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <p>Make sure that the following rules are followed: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Avoid dangerous APIs.</strong> Replace unsafe functions with their safe alternatives, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>CRT string functions, such as strcpy_s, sprintf_s, and strcat_s.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>CRT memory functions, such as memcpy_s and memmove_s.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Allocate correct memory amounts.</strong> When calculating size, make sure your math is correct:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Don’t assume anything about the size of input data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Don’t forget to count the NULL terminator.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Pay attention to byte counts vs. character counts, especially when dealing with other encoding types such as UNICODE.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When copying data into a buffer, check the length of the buffer against the length of data being passed in, to ensure there is enough room.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When appending data into a buffer, ensure that the target buffer has enough room to contain the copied data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When modifying the data in an array, ensure that the array index is within the bounds of the array allocation. Be careful of off by one errors in arrays since 0 based array indexing means that the largest array index will be one less than the allocated size. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you are using a function that copies variable-length data into a buffer and uses a maximum length parameter properly, be sure to pass the correct value into this parameter. Be careful about confusing target length with source length.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Make sure that the code does not rely on another layer or tier for data truncation. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you see a problem, make sure the code truncates the data instead of expanding the buffer to fit it. Buffer expansion may just move the problem downstream. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use stack canaries.</strong> Enable compiler-provided protections against stack overflows: /GS for Microsoft VS compiler, and StackGuard for GCC. Both compiler protections add a process-specific random value (canary) to the stack, right before the return address. Before returning from a function call, the canary is compared with the process-specific value. If the canary was altered, the process is terminated.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Be aware of DEP.</strong> In addition, the latest versions of Windows support Data Execution Prevention (DEP), aimed at detecting tampering with frame-based exception handlers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Be aware of ASLR.</strong> Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is an operating system feature introduced in Windows Vista to randomize the application address space. Buffer overflow exploits are strings of opcodes injected into running processes. Without a proper linking and loading phase, exploit code must guess a few fixed addresses in order to reference system functions and work properly. Windows Vista provides ASLR, which involves randomization of the positions of data areas and libraries, preventing exploit code from being able to easily predict target addresses.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Example</h1>
  <p>The application should not contain code similar to the following example. </p>
  <pre>public void ProcessInput(){<br />   char[] data = new char[255];<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; GetData(data);<br />}<br /><br />public void GetData(char[] buffer){<br />   int ch = 0;<br />   fixed (char* pBuf = buffer){<br />   &amp;nbsp; do<br />   &amp;nbsp; {<br />   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ch = System.Console.Read();<br />   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *(pBuf++) = (char)ch;<br />   &amp;nbsp; }<br />     while(ch != '\n');<br />   }<br />}</pre>
  <p>In this code example, an overflow occurs whenever a single line is more than 255 characters long. There are two problems in this code: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The ProcessInput function allocates only enough space for 255 characters. </li>
    <li>The GetData function does not check the size of the array as it fills it. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>An encryption key is a secret number used as input to the encryption and decryption processes. For encrypted data to remain secure, the key must be protected. If an attacker compromises the decryption key, your encrypted data is no longer secure.</p>
  <p>The following practices help secure your encryption keys:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use&amp;nbsp;Platform Provided&amp;nbsp;Key Management.&amp;nbsp;</strong>One of the major advantages of using platform provided key management is that the key management issue is handled by the operating system. For example, if you are using the .NET framework, you can use DPAPI to handle key management. The key that DPAPI uses is derived from the password that is associated with the process account that calls the DPAPI functions. You can use DPAPI to pass the burden of key management to the operating system.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Cycle Your Keys Periodically.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Generally, a static secret is more likely to be discovered over time. Questions to keep in mind are: Did you write it down somewhere? Did Bob, the administrator with the secrets, change positions in your company or leave the company? Do not overuse keys.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into
 something that does. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be
 rejected outright.</p>
  <h2>How</h2>
  <p>Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files,
 filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls. Many open redirect problems occur because the programmer assumed that certain inputs could not be modified,
 such as cookies and hidden form fields.</p>
  <p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As
 an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if you are expecting colors such as "red" or "blue."</p>
  <p>Use a whitelist of approved URLs or domains to be used for redirection.</p>]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Ensure that all format string functions are passed a static string which cannot be controlled by the user and that the proper number of arguments are always sent to that function as well. If at all possible, use functions that do not support the %n operator
 in format strings.</p>
  <h2>Why</h2>
  <p>An attacker that can control the contents of a format string may be able to execute arbitrary code.</p>
  <h2>When</h2>
  <p>Avoid using user input in format strings when using formatted input-output functions.</p>
  <h2>How</h2>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure that user input is not used in format strings:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify code that uses formatted input-output functions.</strong> The following is a list of formatted input-output functions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>sprintf </li>
        <li>_snprintf </li>
        <li>printf </li>
        <li>fprintf </li>

        <li>swscanf</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Avoid using formatted functions.</strong> Consider replacing formatted input-output functions with iostream C++ functions, which are not prone to format string vulnerabilities.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>(Re-)Write code to exclude user input from format strings.</strong> Place user input in separate variables and pass it as variadic arguments to the formatted input-output functions, instead of placing it in a format strings.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Examine what algorithms your application uses and for what purpose and ensure that correct algorithm and correct key sizes are being used.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Cryptography only provides real security if it is used appropriately and the right algorithms are used for the right job. The strength of the algorithm is also important.&amp;nbsp; Larger key sizes result in improved security, but performance suffers. Stronger encryption is most important for persisted data that is retained in data stores for prolonged periods of time.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application uses cryptography to provide security, examine what algorithm and key size it uses and the way it is used.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p />It is important to make sure you choose the right algorithm for the right job and to make sure you use a key size that provides a sufficient degree of security. Larger key sizes generally increase security. The following list summarizes the major algorithms together with the key sizes that each uses: <ul><li>Data Encryption Standard (DES) 64-bit key (8 bytes) </li><li>TripleDES 128-bit key or 192-bit key (16 or 24 bytes) </li><li>Rijndael 128-256 bit keys (16-32 bytes) </li><li>RSA 384-16,384 bit keys (48-2,048 bytes) </li></ul><p>For large data encryption, use the TripleDES symmetric encryption algorithm (also&amp;nbsp;called Triple Data Encryption Algorithm, TDEA) . For slower and stronger encryption of large data, use Rijndael,&amp;nbsp;also known as Advanced Encryption Standard(AES). As per NIST&amp;nbsp;recomendations, 192-256-bit AES&amp;nbsp;keys are required for highly sensitive data.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To encrypt data that is to be stored for short periods of time, you can consider using a faster but weaker algorithm such as DES. For digital signatures, use Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) or Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). NIST guidelines suggest that 15360-bit RSA keys are equivalent&amp;nbsp;to 256-bit symmetric keys in strength. For hashing, use the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)1.0. For keyed hashes, use the Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) SHA1.0.</p><h1>Additional Resources</h1><ul><li>For more information see, "Chapter 4 - Design Guidelines for Secure Web Applications" at <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302420.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302420.aspx</a>&amp;nbsp;</li></ul><hr /><p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance.</p>]]></Data>

  <p>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any application that writes user input to an XML file on a server.</li>
  </ul>
  <p />
  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>An XML injection vulnerability will allow an attacker to insert malicious data into XML which resides on the server. Depending on the type of XML parser used (SAX or DOM), this malicious data could be used to either overwrite the values in previous nodes or cause the XML parser to consume an excessive amount of memory on the server.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Modification of previous node values in the XML </li>
    <li>Denial of Service on the server </li>
    <li>Exposure of entire XML document to unauthorized users. </li>
    <li>Addition of new nodes or even entire documents. </li>
    <li>Ability to modify or remove data that should not be accessed.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Dynamic XML generation using untrusted input </li>
    <li>Incorrectly defined schema </li>
    <li>Lack of schema validation </li>
    <li>Failure to validate input and properly encode any dangerous meta characters according to the context</li>
  </ul>
  <a name="Countermeasures">
  </a>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>When loading an XML file on the server validate it against a defined XSD</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Perform context-sensitive encoding of untrusted input</strong>. As with encoding data to be output in HTML, a whitelist approach should be taken. For each context which data is going to be inserted in (element, attribute value, etc.) a set of known-safe characters should be constructed. The data to be added should be checked against the whitelist, and any characters not specifically listed should be encoded. CDATA sections should be used to further ensure that the parser ignores special characters. Ideally, only non-XML values should be accepted from untrusted sources. If an XML blob must be accepted from an untrusted source, it should be manually reassembled from values parsed out and encoded after checking the received blob against an XSD.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Untrusted input should be validated against an inclusion list before use</strong>. For example, use a RegEx pattern, primitive type casting, a domain constraint, or another validator. See the Additional Resources for more information on data validation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Trim XML documents to include only the data that is necessary to the application</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use XML processing pipelines to make the flow of data clear and threats easier to identify</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Remove DOCTYPE element from user input before creating XML objects</strong>.</p>

  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Hash and salt stored passwords.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Storing hashes instead of plain-text passwords assures that an attacker cannot easily recover the passwords if he gains access to the password files. Adding salt to hashed files makes hashes much harder to break with dictionary attacks. Hashing should be applied multiple times, because modern computers can perform hashing operations very quickly. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Hash and salt passwords whenever storing them.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to hash and salt stored passwords:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Generate a random salt value.</strong> Each bit of salt doubles the memory and computational requirements for dictionary attacks. Recommended salt lengths are 64-bit or more. Use a random number generator of your choice to generate a random number of required size. Use this number as the salt. The following example creates a salt 64 characters (256-bit) long:<pre>$salt = hash('sha256', uniqid(mt_rand(), true) . $username);</pre></li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Concatenate the password and the salt.</strong> Use string functions to concatenate the password and the salt. Make sure your buffer is large enough to store the concatenated string to prevent buffer overflows. For example:<pre>$storedHash = $salt . $password;</pre></li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Hash the password and the salt.</strong> Use a strong cryptographic hashing algorithm, such as SHA256, to hash the concatenated password and salt. For example:<pre>for ( $i = 0; $i &lt; 50000; $i ++ )<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; $storedHash = hash('sha256', $storedHash);<br />}</pre></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Store the hash and the salt.</strong> Store the hash in the file or database of your choosing. It is important to store both the hash and the salt, because the salt will have to be used when comparing user entered passwords to the hashed value.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Implement password verification.</strong> During authentication, the password entered by the user should be checked against the hashed and salted value. To do this, retrieve the hash value and the salt from password storage. Concatenate user input with the stored salt, hash the resulting string and compare the resulting string against the stored hash. If the resulting hash is the same as the stored hash, the user has entered the correct password. In the following example, <em>$userPassword</em> is the user enter password that needs to be validated and<em> $storedHash</em> is the stored salted hash:</p>
      <pre>$salt = substr($storedHash, 0, 64);<br />$validateHash = $salt . $userPassword;<br />for ( $i = 0; $i &lt; 50000; $i ++ )<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; $validateHash = hash('sha256', $validateHash);<br />}<br />$validateHash = $salt . $validateHash;<br />if ($storedHash == $validateHash)<br />{<br />//The entered password is correct.<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />//The entered password is incorrect.<br />}</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Make sure authentication controls fail securely.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Designing authentication to fail securely when abnormal conditions occur reduces the risk of attackers bypassing authentication by disabling it.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following best practices to fail securely:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use generic error messages. </strong>Show generic error messages that supply the user with feedback denoting that some error happened. These messages should be written in a broad way and should not provide too much information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use a global exception handler.</strong> Global exception handlers should catch any unforeseen exceptions that occur. These handlers are a safety net mechanism to ensure that the application does not behave in an unexpected way if an error occurs. </p>
      <p>Catch any specific exceptions first. Use a generic error message, which ensures that no extra information is disclosed to an attacker through the error messages provided. In this specific exception handler, you could write an error message that is more specific to the error in order to help the user.</p>
      <p>Always catch the global exception class last. This picks up any unforeseen errors and keeps your application from leaking potentially harmful information to an attacker or leaving your application in a vulnerable state.</p>
      <p>It is always a best practice to include finally blocks with your try statements, which will ensure that the application reverts back to a secure state when the try block ends. This block will be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Handle errors properly.</strong> Implement proper handling of the application state in error handling code by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Closing all connections to databases or other systems </li>
        <li>Reverting to lower privileges, if applicable </li>
        <li>Closing all sensitive files </li>
        <li>Logging the failure</li>

  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Avoid constructing SQL queries in code that include user input; instead, prefer parameterized stored procedures that use type safe SQL parameters. If stored procedures cannot be used, use parameterized dynamic SQL statements.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Database queries constructed dynamically from user input are susceptible to SQL injection. A successful SQL injection attack enables a malicious user to execute commands on the application's database instance by using the privileges granted to the application's login. Using stored procedures with parameterized SQL is recommended because SQL parameters are type safe and treated as literal values by the database, not as executable code. Parameters are also checked for type and length.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Always use parameterized SQL queries. Avoid constructing SQL queries directly from any input, including form fields, query string parameters, and cookies.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>You have two options for avoiding user input in dynamic SQL queries:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use parameters with stored procedures.</strong> Stored procedures alone will not prevent SQL injection. Lack of parameter usage means that stored procedures will be susceptible to SQL injection, especially if they use unfiltered input. The following code shows how to use <em>SqlParameterCollection</em> when calling a stored procedure:</p>
      <pre>using System.Data;<br />using System.Data.SqlClient;</pre>
      <pre>using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; DataSet userDataset = new DataSet();<br />&amp;nbsp; SqlDataAdapter myCommand = new SqlDataAdapter( <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "LoginStoredProcedure", connection);<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add("@au_id", SqlDbType.VarChar, 11);<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters["@au_id"].Value = AuthId.Text;</pre>
      <pre>&amp;nbsp; myCommand.Fill(userDataset);<br />}</pre>
      <p>In this case, the @au_id parameter is treated as a literal value and not as executable code. Also, the parameter is checked for type and length. In the preceding code example, the input value cannot be longer than 11 characters. If the data does not conform to the type or length defined by the parameter, the <em>SqlParameter</em> class throws an exception.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use parameters with dynamic SQL.</strong> If stored procedures are unavailable, use parameters when constructing dynamic SQL statements. The following code shows how to use <em>SqlParametersCollection</em> with dynamic SQL:</p>
      <pre>using System.Data;<br />using System.Data.SqlClient;</pre>
      <pre>using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; DataSet userDataset = new DataSet();<br />&amp;nbsp; SqlDataAdapter myDataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "SELECT au_lname, au_fname FROM Authors WHERE au_id = @au_id", <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connection);&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add("@au_id", SqlDbType.VarChar, 11);<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters["@au_id"].Value = AuthId.Text;<br />&amp;nbsp; myDataAdapter.Fill(userDataset);<br />}</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An ASP.NET book purchasing application has a query interface that allows book titles and authors to be de retrieved by submitting an ISBN. The application developer writes a SQL query to accomplish this task:</p>
  <pre>string SQLstr = "SELECT book_name, author_name<br />  FROM book WHERE book_ISBN = '" + ISBN.Text + "'";</pre>
  <p>The ISBN input is from a textfield in the web form which is used to directly generate the SQL statement. For example:</p>
  <pre>SELECT book_name, author_name<br />FROM book<br />WHERE book_ISBN = '0321194330'</pre>
  <p>Consider what happens when a user types the following string in the ISBN text box, which is expecting an ISBN in the form nnnnnnnnnn:</p>
  <pre>' ; DROP DATABASE pubs&amp;nbsp; --</pre>
  <p>The code inserts the user's malicious input and generates the following query.</p>
  <pre>SELECT book_name, author_name <br />FROM book <br />WHERE book_ISBN = ''; DROP DATABASE pubs --'</pre>
  <p>In this case, the ' (single quotation mark) character that starts the rogue input terminates the current string literal in the SQL statement. The ; (semicolon) character tells SQL that this is the end of the current statement, which is then followed by the following malicious SQL code. Finally, the -- (double dash) sequence of characters is a SQL comment that tells SQL to ignore the rest of the text. In this case, SQL ignores the closing ' (single quotation mark) character, which would otherwise cause a SQL parser error.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>An ASP.NET book purchasing application has a query interface that allows book titles and authors to be de retrieved by submitting an ISBN. The application developer writes a SQL query to accomplish this task:</p>
  <pre>string SQLstr = "book_name, author_name <br />  FROM book WHERE book_ISBN = '" + ISBN.Text + "'";</pre>
  <p>The ISBN input is from a textfield in the web form which is used to directly generate the SQL statement. For example:</p>
  <pre>SELECTbook_name, author_name <br />FROM book <br />WHERE book_ISBN = '0321194330'</pre>
  <p>The SQL statement can be made safer by re-writing it as a parameterized, stored procedure:</p>
  <pre>using System.Data;<br />using System.Data.SqlClient;</pre>
  <pre>using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))<br />{<br />&amp;nbsp; DataSet userDataset = new DataSet();<br />&amp;nbsp; SqlDataAdapter myDataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "'0321194330'= @isbn", <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; connection);&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add("@isbn", SqlDbType.VarChar, 11);<br />&amp;nbsp; myCommand.SelectCommand.Parameters["@isbn"].Value = ISBN.Text;<br />&amp;nbsp; myDataAdapter.Fill(userDataset);<br />}</pre>
  <p>The SQL query statement is constructed similarly to the first SQL statement, except that the ISBN column selection criteria is represented as a placeholder rather than directly concatenated into the SQL query. The next two lines specify the variable type, the expected length, and the value of the ISBN field used in this particular query.&amp;nbsp; This protects against SQL injection attacks because @isbn is specified as a VarChar, which means it can't possibly be an executable SQL statement. Consequently, it will be interpreted by the database driver as a String literal.&amp;nbsp; </p>
  <p>It is important to note that while parameterized, stored procedures will help reduce the risk of SQL injection, there are other script injection vulnerabilities that will be possible.

  </ul>
  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>Perform output encoding using SpringMVC within an application.</p>
  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <p>Strong output encoding is a control that is typically used to prevent encoding (primarily XSS on the web) issues within an application. This article will describe how to use the built-in mechanisms provided by SpringMVC to perform appropriate output encoding.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>In general, SpringMVC tags perform HTML entity encoding by default (see XSS prevention cheat sheet in references) if they are configured to do so. There are a few ways to enable this mechanism (newer versions of SpringMVC have this enabled by default).</p>
  <p>Enable html escaping on all form elements within the entire application. In order to do this, add this snippet to your <em>web.xml</em>.</p>
  <pre>&lt;context-param&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;param-name&gt;defaultHtmlEscape&lt;/param-name&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;param-value&gt;true&lt;/param-value&gt;<br />&lt;/context-param&gt;</pre>
  <p>Enable html escaping on all form elements within a single page. In order to do this, add this snippet at the top of your jsp page.</p>
  <pre>&lt;spring:htmlEscape defaultHtmlEscape="true" /&gt; </pre>
  <p>Enable html escaping on all form elements within a single form. In order to do this, attribute your form in this way.</p>
  <pre>&lt;form:input path="someFormField" htmlEscape="true" /&gt; </pre>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: An important point to be aware of is that some tags that allow you to disable the encoding performed by the tag. This is sometimes useful, the most common case being where you are allowing administrators for a site add HTML formatted messages to be displayed to users. There may also be cases where users can create formatted messages for other users. These approaches are often not handled properly to prevent XSS. However, through strong input validation, it is possible to allow users to enter limited HTML and still display that safely to users without allowing XSS. </p>
  <p>You can determine if this is being done by simply looking for the <em>htmlEscape="false"</em> attribute in individual SpringMVC tags. If it is set to false, then the HTML entity encoding is disabled (the default is true). </p>
  <p>SpringMVC provides various mechanisms to perform output encoding. However, you must be aware of the encoding properties of the tag(s) you are using and encode appropriately for your given output context. </p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Separate the account administration from the main application interface.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Account administration requires higher privileges than the main application interface. Separating the two interfaces decreases the risk of a normal user being able to escalate his privileges to that of an administrator.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application has an administrative interface, use this guideline to separate it from the main application interface.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps when designing an administrative interface:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Only privileged users can administer all accounts.</strong> Design your application such that the administrative module is separate from the main application interface. Since the separation requires using separate authentication mechanisms for the application and administration, there is a reduced risk of escalation-of-privilege attacks. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Users may be allowed to administer their own accounts.</strong> It may be necessary to allow users to administer their own accounts. This involves the ability to change passwords, account details, etc. Such administration can be done through the main application interface. Because the user is modifying sensitive data, extra security precautions must be enforced:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Force re-authentication.</strong> Enforce re-authentication when modifying the user's password. This helps verify that the user is aware of the password change and is not a victim of a session hijacking. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Modify accounts in sections.</strong> Do not modify all account information at once. Split the account modification procedure in sections. For example, group the account information into credentials, personal data, contact information and additional information. Modifying the account information in groups reduces the risk of information leakage when the user is updating his/her account. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Use SSL when modifying accounts.</strong> The use of SSL provides encryption when transmitting sensitive data over the network. SSL also certifies the authenticity of the application against the user.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>Perform CSRF prevention using Struts 2 within an application.</p>
  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <p>CSRF prevention is a key security control for an application that protects the application and its users from CSRF attacks. This article will describe how to use the built-in mechanisms provided by Struts 2 to perform CSRF prevention.</p>
  <h1>Code Example</h1>
  <p>There is a standard model for CSRF prevention using Struts 2 that involves 3 basic steps</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Update your interceptor stack to include the <em>tokenSessionInterceptor</em>, either including or excluding all methods (all are included here).</p>
      <pre>&lt;interceptor-stack name="myStack"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;interceptor-ref name="defaultStack" /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;interceptor-ref name="tokenSession"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;param name="includeMethods"&gt;*&lt;/param&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/interceptor-ref&gt;<br />&lt;/interceptor-stack&gt;</pre>
      <pre>&lt;default-interceptor-ref name="myStack" /&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Update your action configuration to include or exclude any methods that need or do not need CSRF protection.</p>
      <pre>&lt;action ...&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;interceptor-ref name="tokenSession"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;param name="excludeMethods"&gt;searchBooks,getBook&lt;/param&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/interceptor-ref&gt;<br />&lt;/action&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Use <em>s:token</em> in your JSP form that requests the action.</p>
      <pre>&lt;s:form action="..."&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;s:token /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&lt;/s:form&gt;</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Using these 3 simple steps you can effectively have a session specific per user token used to validate that a request was submitted by a user intentionally.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: There have been effective attacks against various CSRF prevention techniques including this token-based approach when an application has XSS vulnerabilities. Removing XSS is therefore viewed as a prerequisite activity for a complete CSRF prevention mechanism.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, CSRF prevention can function as a strong security control if used properly and applied thoroughly throughout the application. The Struts 2 framework provides a simple series of steps for accomplishing this task. </p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>ASP.NET 4.0</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use page ViewState user key to&amp;nbsp;prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerabilities.&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>A&amp;nbsp;CSRF attack consists of posting a malicious HTTP form to a known, vulnerable Web site.&amp;nbsp;This allows an attacker to perform any action caused by the vulnerable form with the credentials of the victim. <em>ViewStateUserKey</em> makes it much harder for hackers to use the content of the client-side view state to prepare malicious posts against the site. Each time a form is invoked, a unique key is generated. The key contains encrypted time and session information, and the form submission is rejected if it is used in another session or after the session timeout has expired. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All forms which require authentication&amp;nbsp;should be protected with a <em>ViewStateUserKey</em>.&amp;nbsp;Furthermore, if a form triggers important functionality but does not require authentication, it should also be protected—a good example would be a financial transaction.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>The&amp;nbsp;following code added to each&amp;nbsp;of your pages will set the key based on SessionID.</p>
  <pre>void Page_Init (object sender, EventArgs e)<br />{<br />   ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;<br />}</pre>
  <p>Alternatively, you can add this code to the <em>OnInit</em> virtual method of the <em>Page</em>-derived class.&amp;nbsp;(Note that you must set this property in the <em>Page.Init</em> event).&amp;nbsp;This will allow you to write the code once rather than per page.</p>
  <pre>protected override OnInit(EventArgs e)<br />{<br />   base.OnInit(e);<br />   ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;<br />}</pre>
  <p>Setting <em>ViewStateUserKey</em> to a constant string—the same for all users—is like leaving it blank.&amp;nbsp; You must set it to something that varies for each user—user ID or, better yet, session ID.&amp;nbsp; For a number of technical and social reasons, session ID is a much better fit because a session ID is unpredictable, times out, and varies on a per-user basis. </p>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>An e-commerce web site stores all of their customer's billing information and allows them to order merchandise by submitting a single simple form with the item number, quantity, and shipping address.&amp;nbsp;The form is completely static, allowing an attacker who can lure a logged-in user into submitting a form request on the attacker's behalf to order arbitrary items on the victim's account.&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>An e-commerce web site stores all of their customer's billing information and allows them to order merchandise by submitting a single simple form with the item number, quantity, and shipping address.&amp;nbsp;The form uses a <em>ViewStateUserKey</em> set to the session ID, ensuring that even if an attacker can lure a logged-in user into submitting a form on their behalf, the attacker will be unable to construct a valid form submission.&amp;nbsp; </p>

  <p>In general, Struts 2 tags perform HTML entity encoding by default (see XSS prevention cheat sheet in references). The url tag provides a mechanism to perform url encoding on parameter values. A few examples are given below.</p>
  <p>Using <em>s:property</em> to output simple text (performs HTML entity encoding).</p>
  <pre>&lt;s:property value="streetAddress" /&gt;</pre>
  <p>Using <em>s:hidden</em> to output a hidden field (performs HTML entity encoding).</p>
  <pre>&lt;s:hidden name="foo" value="bar" /&gt;</pre>
  <p>Using <em>s:url</em> / <em>s:a</em> to output a url (performs URL encoding on url parameter values).</p>
  <pre>&lt;s:url id="addBookUrl" namespace="/book" action="myBookAction" method="add"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;s:param name="id" value="${bookId}"/&gt;<br />&lt;/s:url&gt;<br />&lt;s:a href="%{addBookUrl}"&gt;Add&lt;/s:a&gt;</pre>

  <p>You can determine if this is being done by simply looking for the escape attribute in struts tags. If it is set to false, then the HTML entity encoding is disabled (the default is true). An example of disabling encoding is shown below.</p>
  <pre>&lt;s:property value="streetAddress" escape="false" /&gt;</pre>
  <p>Struts 2 provides various tags that can perform output encoding. However, you must be aware of the encoding properties of the tag(s) you are using and encode appropriately for your given output context. </p>

      <Data><![CDATA[==Description==

A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack can cause arbitrary code to run in a user's browser while the browser is connected to a trusted Web site. The attack targets your application's users and not the application itself, but it uses your application as the vehicle for the attack. Because the script code is downloaded by the browser from a trusted site, the browser has no way of knowing that the code is not legitimate. As the attacker's code has access to the cookies associated with the trusted site and are stored on the user's local computer, a user's authentication cookies are typically the target of attack.

There are two primary types of XSS, persistent and non-persistent. If the attacker is able to inject his malicious script to the web applications data store, then the script will be persistent and anyone who then loads a page with that content will run the script and become a victim of the attack. Forums and other web services that have user supplied HTML content are a classic example of this. If this content is not validated and encoded then anyone can leave a malicious script on the site. Non-Persistent XSS uses some reflective aspect of the page to deliver the payload. Web applications often echo user input back to them without altering it. Search engines are a good example of this type of behavior. Attackers can create and distribute URLs that contain a malicious script that gets reflected back to the user. The most common example of this is the "page not found" error page which echoes the requested page back to the user.

The most common attack performed with cross-site scripting involves the disclosure of information stored in user cookies. In some circumstances it may be possible to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer when cross-site scripting is combined with other flaws. Even if an attacker cannot get at the authentication information of a user, they can act as that user.

  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>Perform output encoding using JSF within an application.</p>
  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <p>Strong output encoding is a control that is typically used to prevent encoding (primarily XSS on the web) issues within an application. This article will describe how to use the built-in mechanisms provided by JSF to perform appropriate output encoding.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>In general, JSF tags perform HTML entity encoding by default (see XSS prevention cheat sheet in references). A few examples are given below.</p>
  <p>Using <em>h:outputText</em> to output simple text (performs HTML entity encoding).</p>
  <pre>&lt;h:outputText value="#{someManagedBean.someValue}" /&gt;</pre>
  <p>Using h:outputLabel to output simple text (performs HTML entity encoding).</p>
  <pre>&lt;h:outputLabel value="#{someManagedBean.someValue}" /&gt;</pre>
  <p>Using <em>h:outputLink</em> to output a url (performs URL encoding on url parameter values).</p>
  <pre>&lt;h:outputLink value="#{form.welcomeURL}"&gt;<br />&lt;h:outputText value="#{form.welcomeLinkText}"/&gt;<br />&lt;/h:outputLink&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: An important point to be aware of is that there are a few tags that allow you to disable the encoding performed by the tag. This is sometimes useful, the most common case being where you are allowing administrators for a site add HTML formatted messages to be displayed to users. There may also be cases where users can create formatted messages for other users. These approaches are often not handled properly to prevent XSS. However, through strong input validation, it is possible to allow users to enter limited HTML and still display that safely to users without allowing XSS. </p>
  <p>You can determine if this is being done by simply looking for the escape attribute in JSF tags. If it is set to false, then the HTML entity encoding is disabled (the default is true). An example of disabling encoding is shown below.</p>
  <pre>&lt;h:outputText value="#{someManagedBean.someValue}" escape="false" /&gt;</pre>
  <p>Another important note is that while the <em>f:verbatim</em> tag can perform output encoding, it by default does not. If you see something like the following, it is unsafe.</p>
  <pre>//DO NOT USE<br />&lt;f:verbatim&gt; Untrusted data &lt;/f:verbatim&gt;</pre>
  <p>JSF provides various tags that can perform output encoding. However, you must be aware of the encoding properties of the tag(s) you are using and encode appropriately for your given output context. </p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Only copy the amount of data that can fit in the array or string. Make sure that the array or string is large enough to fit all the data, including the possible trailing null.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Copying more data than an array or string can fit results in a buffer overflow.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Allocate enough buffer space for copying data, when data is being copied to an array or a string.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following steps to assure that your code allocates enough buffer space when copying data to prevent buffer overflows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify all functions that copy data to strings or arrays.</strong> List the components, modules, and libraries that do the most amount of data handling. Usually there exists some code heavy on manipulating data that copies many buffers or constructs various strings.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Calculate the amount of memory that is used by data being copied or set a maximum size limit for valid data.</strong> Make sure to include a trailing null if a null-terminated string is being copied. When calculating the size of data, count the amount of memory it uses, not the amount of elements in the array. Be careful when using the sizeof() function, because it returns the size of a pointer when an array containing data is passed as a parameter to the function. The memory size of data should be calculated beforehand, ideally in the same scope in which the data structure containing data is declared, and passed as an argument to the function that does the copying.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Allocate memory for the buffer.</strong> Once the amount of memory needed to fit all the data is determined, allocate an array or a string of a sufficient size. Write code to handle possible memory allocation errors.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check bounds when copying.</strong> Use the size of the allocated array or string when copying to assure that only the amount of data that fits into the array is copied. This should always be the case if the amount of memory to allocate is calculated correctly, but for extra security it is a good idea to write code in a way that truncates data if it doesn't fit into the buffer.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>Perform CSRF prevention using SpringMVC within an application.</p>
  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <p>CSRF prevention is a key security control for an application. It protects application users from CSRF attacks. This article will describe how to use the built-in mechanisms provided by SpringMVC to perform CSRF prevention.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>There is a standard model for CSRF prevention using SpringMVC that involves 3 basic steps</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Build a base controller with CSRF generation and validation methods.</strong>
      </p>
      <pre>public class RootController {<br />...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; protected void init(ControllerContext ctx) {<br />&amp;nbsp;...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; initializeCsfrToken(ctx);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }</pre>
      <pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; private void initializeCsfrToken(ControllerContext ctx) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; String csrfToken = ctx.getSessionAttribute(ControllerContext.CSRF_TOKEN, "");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if(Utils.isEmpty(csrfToken)) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ctx.setSessionAttribute(ctx, ControllerContext.CSRF_TOKEN, generateCsrfToken(ctx));<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; private String generateCsrfToken(ControllerContext ctx) {<br />&amp;nbsp;... generate random string<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; protected boolean isValidCsrfToken(ControllerContext ctx) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; String csrfParamToken = ctx.getParameter(ControllerContext.CSRF_TOKEN);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; String csrfSessionToken = ctx.getSessionAttribute(ControllerContext.CSRF_TOKEN, "");<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if(!Utils.isEmpty(csrfParamToken) &amp;&amp; !Utils.isEmpty(csrfSessionToken) &amp;&amp; csrfParamToken.equals(csrfSessionToken)) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return true;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; } else {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; //Log this as this can be a security threat<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Log.warn("Invalid security Token. Supplied token: " + csrfParamToken + ". Session token: " + csrfSessionToken + ". IP: " + ctx.request.getRemoteAddr());<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return false;<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Include CSRF token in form submitted via JSP.</strong>
      </p>
      <pre>&lt;input type="hidden" name="ctoken" id="ctoken" value="${sessionScope.ctoken}"/&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>In Controller handling request, validate CSRF token. </strong>In the action class/method that handles the saving of your form (ex. <em>SaveBookController</em>), you need to perform the token validation. </p>
      <pre>...<br />ControllerContext ctx = new ControllerContext(request, response);<br />init(ctx);<br />if (!isValidCsrfToken(ctx)) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; result.addError(new ObjectError("employee", getMessage("error.invalidCsrfToken")));<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return getModelAndView(ctx, "employee/list");<br />}<br />...</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Using these 3 simple steps you can effectively have a session specific per user token used to validate that a request was submitted by a user intentionally.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: There have been effective attacks against various CSRF prevention techniques including this token-based approach when an application has XSS vulnerabilities. Removing XSS is therefore viewed as a prerequisite activity for a complete CSRF prevention mechanism.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, CSRF prevention can function as a strong security control if used properly and applied thoroughly throughout the application. The SpringMVC framework provides a simple series of steps for accomplishing this task. </p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>A heap-based buffer overflow overwrites buffers allocated from the heap, overflowing into the heap management data structures.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <p>A heap buffer overflow may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. A heap buffer overflow allows an attacker to overwrite an arbitrary 32-bit memory location with an arbitrary 32-bit value. When the memory location is a function pointer, for example, an entry in a v-table, and the value is the address of malicious opcodes, then an attacker can run arbitrary code.</p>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <p>A heap buffer overflow occurs for the same reasons as a stack buffer overflow, but takes places on the heap, instead of on the stack. Because of this, exploitation of heap-based buffer overflows is different that exploitation of stack-based buffer-overflows. On the Windows platform, the following pointer exchange is executed whenever memory is allocated or freed from the heap:</p>
  <pre>mov dword ptr ds:[eax], ecx<br />mov dword ptr ds:[ecx+4], eax</pre>
  <p>An attacker can create, and supply to a vulnerable application, meticulously-crafted overflow data. The eax and ecx registers can be populated with values out of the overflow data. When the pointer exchange occurs, an arbitrary 32-bit memory location can be overwritten with an arbitrary 32-bit value. When the memory location is a function pointer, for example, an entry in a v-table, and the value is the address of malicious opcodes, then an attacker can run arbitrary code.</p>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <p>Use the following techniques to defend from heap based buffer overflows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Allocate correct memory amounts.</strong> When calculating size, make sure your math is correct:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Don’t assume anything about the size of input data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Don’t forget to count the NULL terminator.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Pay attention to byte counts vs. character counts, especially when dealing with other encoding types such as UNICODE.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When copying data into a buffer, check the length of the buffer against the length of data being passed in, to ensure there is enough room.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When appending data into a buffer, ensure that the target buffer has enough room to contain the copied data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When modifying the data in an array, ensure that the array index is within the bounds of the array allocation. Be careful of off by one errors in arrays since 0 based array indexing means that the largest array index will be one less than the allocated size. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you are using a function that copies variable-length data into a buffer and uses a maximum length parameter properly, be sure to pass the correct value into this parameter. Be careful about confusing target length with source length.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Make sure that the code does not rely on another layer or tier for data truncation. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you see a problem, make sure the code truncates the data instead of expanding the buffer to fit it. Buffer expansion may just move the problem downstream. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Be aware of DEP.</strong> In addition, the latest versions of Windows support Data Execution Prevention (DEP), aimed at detecting tampering with frame-based exception handlers. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Be aware of ASLR.</strong> Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is an operating system feature introduced in Windows Vista to randomize the application address space. Buffer overflow exploits are strings of opcodes injected into running processes. Without a proper linking and loading phase, exploit code must guess a few fixed addresses in order to reference system functions and work properly. Windows Vista provides ASLR, which involves randomization of the positions of data areas and libraries, preventing exploit code from being able to easily predict target addresses.</p>

Enabling SSL for the entire site may require additional computing resources, so for performance reasons, it may be acceptable to enable SSL only for sensitive pages. To enable SSL only for sensitive pages:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive pages.</strong> Make a list of all pages that handle sensitive information, including all pages that use authentication or authorization features.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enable SSL for each directory containing sensitive pages.</strong> The exact instructions for doing so are different for different web servers. Use the web server administration interface or edit the server configuration files to enable SSL for all folders containing sensitive pages.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Redirect non-SSL requests to SSL-protected pages.</strong> This can be accomplished by editing the<em> .htaccess</em> file in each directory with sensitive pages and adding the folowing lines:<pre>RewriteEngine On<br />RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !on<br />RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}</pre></li>
    <p>The <em>$_SERVER['HTTPS']</em> variable can be used to programmatically determine if SSL is being used and take action accordingly.</p>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>Implementing protections that prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) within a JSF application.</p>
  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <p>CSRF is a powerful attack that allows an attacker to force a victim to execute functionality within an application on behalf of the attacker. The example below gives an example of how to prevent CSRF within a JSF application.</p>
  <h1>Scenarios</h1>
  <p>CSRF is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious web site causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated, causing the victim to perform activities on behalf of the attacker. In order to prevent CSRF, the most common effective solution currently used is the synchronizer token pattern. The flow below shows the basic steps in prevention. </p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>To add unique tokens to HTTP requests using JSF:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Store a randomly generated token for each authenticated user.</strong> Upon successful authentication of a user, store a randomly generated (using a secure pseudo-random number generator such as <em>java.security.SecureRandom</em>) string (token) in the <em>HttpSession</em> for the user.</p>
      <pre>
        <p>//in authentication function</p>
        <p>session.setAttribute("csrfToken", generateCSRFToken());       </p>
        <p>//sample implementation of token generation</p>
        <p>public static String generateCSRFToken() {</p>
        <p>	SecureRandom rng = new SecureRandom();</p>
        <p>	int length = 64;</p>
        <p>	String characters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";</p>
        <p>	char[] text = new char[length];</p>
        <p>	for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {</p>
        <p>		text[i] = characters.charAt(rng.nextInt(characters.length()));</p>
        <p>	}</p>
        <p>	return String.valueOf(text);</p>
        <p>}     </p>
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Add security tokens to transaction pages.</strong> For any function in the application representing a transaction (ie. causes a server side state change), the associated client form should have a hidden form field containing the token retrieved from the session.</p>
      <pre> &lt;h:form&gt;<br /><p>	...</p><p>	&lt;h:inputHidden id="token" value="#{sessionScope['csrfToken']}" /&gt;</p><p>	...</p><p>&lt;/h:form&gt;</p></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that&amp;nbsp;server-side and client-side tokens match.</strong>&amp;nbsp;For any function in the application representing a transaction (ie. causes a server side state change), the associated server-side request processing code should retrieve the token from the session. It should then compare that token to the submitted token from the client for the given request. If the tokens match, the transaction may be processed. If the tokens do not match, the transaction should not be processed, and the associated request should be treated as an attack and dealt with accordingly.</p>
      <pre>
        <p>//in your backing bean that handles the associated request from the form above</p>
        <p>private String token;</p>
        <p>public String getToken() {</p>
        <p>	return token;</p>
        <p>}</p>
        <p>public void setToken(String token) {</p>
        <p>	this.token = token;</p>
        <p>}</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>//method that handles form submit</p>
        <p>public void action() {</p>
        <p>	FacesContext facesContext = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();</p>
        <p>	HttpSession session = (HttpSession) facesContext.getExternalContext().getSession(false);</p>
        <p>	String storedToken = (String)session.getAttribute("csrfToken");</p>
        <p>	//do check</p>
        <p>	if (storedToken.equals(token)) {</p>
        <p>		//go ahead and process ... do business logic here</p>
        <p>	} else {</p>
        <p>		//DO NOT PROCESS ... this is to be considered a CSRF attack - handle appropriately</p>
        <p>	}</p>
        <p>}</p>
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Invalidate sessions upon logout or expiration.</strong> Upon logout or session timeout, invalidate the session, which will in turn void the generated random token</p>
      <pre>
        <p>//in logout function</p>
        <p>session.invalidate();</p>
      </pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Include unique tokens in HTTP requests when performing sensitive operations to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>CSRF may be possible when an attacker can form a URL, which performs an action on the behalf of an authenticated user. Forming such URLs becomes much more difficult, if unique tokens are included in HTTP requests. Including difficult to predict token in HTTP requests is an effective defense against CSRF attacks.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>To include unique tokens in HTTP requests:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive operations.</strong> Review application design and code to identify all operations that require authorization.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify code that performs sensitive operations. </strong>Identify all pages that are involved in performing sensitive operations - this includes both the pages that link to sensitive operations and the code that actually carries out the sensitive operations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Choose a method for generating unique tokens.</strong> There are different ways to generate unique tokens. One approach is to use the uniqid function combined with a hash based on current time. For example: <pre>uniqid(md5(microtime()), true);</pre></li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Add the unique token to the session.</strong> Add code that adds the generates unique tokens and stores them in session variables to the pages that link to sensitive operations. For example: <pre>session_start();<br />$_SESSION['CSRFToken'] = uniqid(md5(microtime()), true);</pre></li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Add unique tokens to HTTP requests.</strong> Add code that sends the generated unique tokens in HTTP requests to the pages that link to sensitive operations. One of the simplest ways to do this is to include the tokens in hidden fields in forms. For example:<pre>&lt;input type="hidden" name="CSRFToken" value="&lt;?php echo $_SESSION['CSRFToken'] ?&gt;" /&gt;</pre></li>
    <li>
      <p />
      <strong>Add token validation code.</strong> Add code to the pages that carry out sensitive operations that compares the tokens sent in HTTP requests to the tokens stored in session variables. Comparing the tokens in HTTP requests to tokens in session variables makes sure that the tokens are generated by the server as a part of normal application workflow and therefore the requested action is being performed by a legitimate user. The validation code should look something like the following:<pre>session_start();<p /><p>if ($_POST['CSRFToken'] !== $_SESSION['CSRFToken']) {<br />&amp;nbsp; // The tokens don't match - possible CSRF detected<br />&amp;nbsp; die('Possible CSRF');<br />}<br />// Validation passed, so tokens match - perform the sensitive operation</p></pre></li>
  </ol>

      <Data><![CDATA[==What to Do==

Understand the context in which your data will be used and the encoding that will be expected. This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when generating outputs that can contain multiple encodings at the same time, such as web pages or multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations to determine the required encoding strategies.

For any data that will be output to another web page, especially any data that was received from external inputs, use the appropriate encoding on all non-alphanumeric characters. Parts of the same output document may require different encodings, which will vary depending on whether the output is in the:

*HTML body
*Element attributes (such as src="XYZ")
*URIs
*JavaScript sections
*Cascading Style Sheets and style properties
*etc.

**Note:** HTML Entity Encoding is only appropriate for the HTML body. Consult the XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet for more details on the types of encoding and escaping that are needed.

==Why==

Proper encoding of echoed input prevents cross-site scripting attacks.

==When==

If user input will be echoed back to the client in any way, encode it before displaying it. This includes input that is immediately echoed back as well as input that is stored first (such as in a database) before being echoed back later.

==How==

To escape HTML characters in user input:

# **Identify all echoed input.** Locate all places inside your application where user-supplied data will be returned to the client. Such data can be of a reflective or persistent nature. In a reflective setting, the input is immediately returned to the client. For example, search engines present the searched query when displaying the results. In a persistent setting, the input is stored and returned to the client when retrieved from the database. For example, message boards store the users' posts inside a database and return them when a given topic is viewed.
# **Determine the type of encoding.** After identifying all echoed input, determine how the input is returned to the client. Data is said to be in a HTML context when that data is rendered as a part of a HTML document and is understood by the browser to be HTML. There are other contexts available to Web Applications, such as JavaScript context, CSS context, etc. Data is said to be in a JavaScript context when it is included in JavaScript code and is interpreted as JavaScript by the browser, and so on. Data has to be encoded differently for different contexts to prevent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. The differences of encoding arise from the fact that different contexts have different special symbols and keywords. Output encoding routines have to be designed with the understanding of the context of the output in mind.
## **URL encoding:** URL encoding allows your application to maintain the original URL, yet display it to the user in a non-malicious way. Because HTTP headers allow a substitution schema, all characters/symbols are preserved by displaying their ASCII codes instead of the actual character/symbol.
## **HTML encoding:** HTML encoding is used when the echoed input is returned as regular text or HTML content. Input should be encoded by substituting certain characters with their respective HTML values
## **HTML Attribute Encoding:** HTML Attribute encoding is used to encode dynamic data that is output in an attribute of an HTML tag, except URL, CSS, and JavaScript event handler attributes.
## **JavaScript Encoding:** JavaScript encoding is used to encode dynamic data that is output into the JavaScript context, including certain event handlers in HTML tags.
## **CSS Encoding:** CSS encoding is used to encode dynamic data that is output into the CSS context.
## **DOM Encoding:** DOM encoding is used to encode dynamic data that is used in situations where the DOM is involved. These instances are more complicated and often involve multiple output contexts, which necessitates chaining in many circumstances.
# **Apply the encoding.** After identifying the echoed input and determining the appropriate encoding method, apply the encoding before the input is returned to the client. There are different encoding libraries available. Different libraries have different capabilities and weaknesses. Please refer to the vendor's documentation for each potential encoding library.

  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>Perform output encoding using JSF within an application.</p>
  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <p>Strong output encoding is a control that is typically used to prevent encoding (primarily XSS on the web) issues within an application. This article will describe how to use the built-in mechanisms provided by JSF to perform appropriate output encoding.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>In general, JSF tags perform HTML entity encoding by default (see XSS prevention cheat sheet in references). A few examples are given below.</p>
  <p>Using <em>h:outputText</em> to output simple text (performs HTML entity encoding).</p>
  <pre>&lt;h:outputText value="#{someManagedBean.someValue}" /&gt;</pre>
  <p>Using h:outputLabel to output simple text (performs HTML entity encoding).</p>
  <pre>&lt;h:outputLabel value="#{someManagedBean.someValue}" /&gt;</pre>
  <p>Using <em>h:outputLink</em> to output a url (performs URL encoding on url parameter values).</p>
  <pre>&lt;h:outputLink value="#{form.welcomeURL}"&gt;<br />&lt;h:outputText value="#{form.welcomeLinkText}"/&gt;<br />&lt;/h:outputLink&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: An important point to be aware of is that there are a few tags that allow you to disable the encoding performed by the tag. This is sometimes useful, the most common case being where you are allowing administrators for a site add HTML formatted messages to be displayed to users. There may also be cases where users can create formatted messages for other users. These approaches are often not handled properly to prevent XSS. However, through strong input validation, it is possible to allow users to enter limited HTML and still display that safely to users without allowing XSS. </p>
  <p>You can determine if this is being done by simply looking for the escape attribute in JSF tags. If it is set to false, then the HTML entity encoding is disabled (the default is true). An example of disabling encoding is shown below.</p>
  <pre>&lt;h:outputText value="#{someManagedBean.someValue}" escape="false" /&gt;</pre>
  <p>Another important note is that while the <em>f:verbatim</em> tag can perform output encoding, it by default does not. If you see something like the following, it is unsafe.</p>
  <pre>//DO NOT USE<br />&lt;f:verbatim&gt; Untrusted data &lt;/f:verbatim&gt;</pre>
  <p>JSF provides various tags that can perform output encoding. However, you must be aware of the encoding properties of the tag(s) you are using and encode appropriately for your given output context. </p>

  <p>If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code.</p>

  <p>Structured command execution mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.
</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Where possible, identify any function that invokes a command shell using a single string, and replace it with a function that requires individual arguments. These functions typically perform appropriate quoting and filtering of arguments. For example, in
 C, the <em>system()</em> function accepts a string that contains the entire command to be executed, whereas
<em>execl()</em>, <em>execve()</em>, and others require an array of strings, one for each argument. In Windows,
<em>CreateProcess()</em> only accepts one command at a time. In Perl, if <em>system()</em> is provided with an array of arguments, then it will quote each of the arguments.</p>]]></Data>

  <p>Ensure that you perform access control checks related to your business logic. These checks may be different than the access control checks that you apply to more generic resources such as files, connections, processes, memory, and database records. For example,
 a database may restrict access for medical records to a specific database user, but each record might only be intended to be accessible to the patient and the patient's doctor.</p>]]></Data>

  <p>All applications.</p>
  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Command injection problems are a subset of injection problems in which the process is tricked into either executing code or calling external processes of the attacker's choice through the injection of control information into the data stream.</p>
  <h1>Impact</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Elevation of Privilege:</strong> Command injection can allow for the execution of arbitrary commands and code by the attacker. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Vulnerabilities</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Failure to Validate User Input:</strong> Situations where control information and data are mixed create opportunities for command injection.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Countermeasures</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Validate user input</strong>. Prevent commands from being included in data by validating input for type, length, range, and format. Whitelist acceptable input and reject everything else. Escape meta characters and be aware of canonicalization issues. Remember that data may be changed as it flows through the program, so validating at multiple stages is often appropriate. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Do not use input data in commands directly</strong>. Clever formatting may be used so that the user's input is treated as its own separate command instead of as data. Therefore, validate the input and explicitly type it as data so that it cannot be interpreted as a command even if it contains one. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid using command interpreters</strong>. Although not always practical, using a well maintained API will have better results than invoking commands through an interpreter or external process.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Example</h1>
  <p>The following code is a web wrapper around the ImageMagick command "convert":</p>
  <pre>&lt;?php
$filename=$_GET['file'];
$old_fmt=$_GET['old'];
$new_fmt=$_GET['new'];

$cmd = 'convert $filename.$old_fmt $filename.$new_fmt 2&gt;&amp;1';
echo `$cmd`;
?&gt;
</pre>
  <br />
  <br />This could be used as part of an image upload page where a user posts an image, it's saved to the file system, then this call is performed asynchronously. There are multiple issues with such a flow, but the most critical is the command injection vulnerability it introduces. Consider what a URL might look like under normal operation:<br /><br /><pre>http://example.com/convert.php?file=kittycat&amp;old=png&amp;new=jpg</pre><br /><br />This would construct a command that would look like the following:<br /><br /><pre>convert kittycat.png kittycat.jpg 2&gt;&amp;1</pre><br /><br />If the file exists the page would return nothing; if the file does not exist or there is another problem lack of error handling would disclose sensitive information about how the script works back to the user. Even worse than the information that an attacker could obtain through this is the fact that she can now execute arbitrary commands. Consider the following URL:<br /><br /><br /><pre>http://example.com/convert.php?file=kittycat&amp;old=png&amp;new=jpg%3bcat+%2fetc%2fpasswd</pre><br />This would construct a much more dangerous command:<br /><br /><pre>convert kittycat.png kittycat.jpg; cat /etc/passwd 2&gt;&amp;1</pre><br /><br />The <font face="Courier New">convert</font> command would likely silently succeed followed by the <font face="Courier New">cat</font> command which would dump the contents of <font face="Courier New">/etc/passwd</font> back to the attacker. Note that even though in this example the attacker sees feedback from the injection, methods exist for exploiting scenarios where injection displays no output. In such cases an attacker could, for example, use the <font face="Courier New">sleep</font> command to detect the existence of a blind injection issue. Once found, such a vulnerability is easily exploited. <br /><br />
Another example of this type of behavior can be seen with XSL, the style sheet language for XML. The primary purpose of XSL is to provide an easy and modular way to transform XML documents into other XML documents such as HTML. In particular, different XSL styles can be attached to the same XML and are sometimes supplied by the user. Microsoft extended the functionality of XSL to allow scripting code to be embedded in the style sheets with the &lt;msxsl:script&gt; tag. If an attacker has the ability to modify or replace the XSL style sheet in use, they can therefore inject any command to the system running the application simply by including it in the style sheet.
  <p>In many programming languages there is an eval() function that, as the name suggests, evaluates a string as an expression. Among the members of this list are the commonly used JavaScript, ASP, Python, Perl, Ruby, and PHP. Blurring the distinction between data and code presents a huge security risk; this case is no different. User input is sometimes used in eval() expressions allowing arbitrary code to be executed. Consider an example where eval() is used in a php to set variables equal to one based on GET parameters:</p><pre>$turn_on=explode('|', $_GET['var']);

foreach ($turn_on as $var){
    eval('$var = 1');
}
</pre><p>The developer may expect a URL that looks like the following:</p><pre>http://example.com/set.php?turn_on=foo|bar|baz</pre><br /><br /><font face="Arial">This would result in evaluations that could be represented with the following code:<br /><br /></font><pre>foo=1;
bar=1;
baz=1;
</pre><p>However, imagine instead that the user tried a different URL:</p><pre>http://example.com/set.php?turn_on=foo%3d1%3bphpinfo()%3bbar|baz</pre><p>The evaluated code would look a little different:</p><pre>foo=1; <br />phpinfo();<br />bar=1;<br />baz=1;<br /></pre><p>Rather than simply set variables to 1, the script now dumps to an attacker information about the installation and configuration of PHP on the system he is attacking. Any system command or external program in the path could be run in this fashion.</p><h1>Additional Resources</h1><ul><li>For more information on Command Injection, see the <a href="http://www.e-articles.info/e/a/title/Command-Injection/">Command Injection </a>article at e-articles.info. </li><li>For more information on the Javascript Eval function, see the Wikipedia Eval article at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eval">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eval</a>.</li></ul><ul></ul>]]></Data>

      <Data><![CDATA[<h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Ensure that encryption is properly integrated into the system design, including but not necessarily limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encryption that is needed to store or transmit private data of the users of the system</li>
    <li>Encryption that is needed to protect the system itself from unauthorized disclosure or tampering</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How</h2>
  <p>To integrate encryption into the system:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive data.</strong> Clearly specify which data or resources are valuable enough that they should be protected by encryption. Require that any transmission or storage of this data/resource should use well-vetted encryption algorithms.
 Use naming conventions and strong types to make it easier to spot when sensitive data is being used. When creating structures, objects, or other complex entities, separate the sensitive and non-sensitive data as much as possible.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify where to use encryption.</strong> Using threat modeling or other techniques, assume that your data can be compromised through a separate vulnerability or weakness, and determine where encryption will be most effective. Ensure that data you
 believe should be private is not being inadvertently exposed using weaknesses such as insecure permissions (CWE-732).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify encryption requirements.</strong> Identify the separate needs and contexts for encryption:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>One-way</strong> (i.e., only the user or recipient needs to have the key). This can be achieved using public key cryptography, or other techniques in which the encrypting party (i.e., the software) does not need to have access to a private key.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Two-way</strong> (i.e., the encryption can be automatically performed on behalf of a user, but the key must be available so that the plaintext can be automatically recoverable by that user). This requires storage of the private key in a format that
 is recoverable only by the user (or perhaps by the operating system) in a way that cannot be recovered by others.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use strong encryption algorithms.</strong> Select a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and select well-tested implementations. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be available
 for analysis. For example, US government systems require FIPS 140-2 certification. Periodically ensure that you aren't using obsolete cryptography. Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days
 or hours. This includes MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, and other algorithms that were once regarded as strong. When you use industry-approved techniques, you need to use them correctly. Don't cut corners by skipping resource-intensive steps (CWE-325). These steps are
 often essential for preventing common attacks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Do not develop your own cryptographic algorithms. </strong>They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If your algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how
 it works, then it is especially weak.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Compartmentalize the system.</strong> Compartmentalize your system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with
 a compartment outside of the safe area.</p>

  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using direct object references may expose sensitive data to attackers. Direct object references often expose sensitive data, such as files, database entries, or personal information. Direct object reference attacks are very simple to execute and have been used in high profile, low-skill attacks.

  <ol>
    <li>

        <strong>Identify pages that use direct object references.</strong> Make a list of all pages in the application. Go through the list and identify all pages that use indirect object references by examining each page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify code that references objects.</strong> For each page that uses indirect object references, identify the code that references objects.</p>

Use helper classes to assure input validation.

==Why==

Helper classes may help make sure that user input has been validated.

==When==

Use helper classes when handling user input.

==How==

Perform the following actions to assure that user input is validated:

# **Define a helper class.** Define a container class for user input. Since user input is most likely to be in the form of a string, declare a private string member. Declare an accessor for retrieving the value of the string member.
# **Define a validation function.** Define a private validation function as a member of the helper class. This validation function may call other validation functions that are implemented in the input validation class or library.
# **Define a modifier.** Define a modifier for the helper class that takes user input as an argument. Call the private validation function on user input. Return an error if user input is not valid. If user input is valid, assign user input as the value for the private string member. Now, whenever an instance of this helper class has data assigned to it, there is assurance that the data it contains has been validated.
# **Use the helper class.** Identify all locations where user input is handled. Replace direct operations on user input with operations using the helper class.]]></Data>

Allow only trusted hosts to connect to the database server.

==Why==

Direct access allows an attacker to establish a connection to the SQL Server and issue commands. This could lead to unauthorized access to data.

==How==

Perform the following actions to restrict access to your SQL Server:

# **Restrict access from the outside.** Configure the firewall to make sure that SQL server ports are not visible from outside of the perimeter network.
# **Restrict access from within the perimeter.** Restrict direct access by unauthorized internal hosts via internal firewalls and port filtering.
# **Minimize exposure.** The production database server should only be accessible from the application server(s) it works with and a minimum set of other maintenance systems for monitoring, external logging, backup, and administration. Development and production systems should not share the same database server, and development machines should not have access to the production servers.]]></Data>

  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>Perform CSRF prevention using Struts 1 within an application.</p>
  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <p>CSRF prevention is a key security control for an application that protects the application and its users from CSRF attacks. This article will describe how to use the built-in mechanisms provided by Struts 1 to perform CSRF prevention.</p>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>There is a standard model for CSRF prevention using Struts 1 that involves 3 basic steps</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Call <em>saveToken</em>().</strong> In the action class/method that handles the setup for your form display (ex. <em>EditBookAction</em>), you need to call <em>saveToken</em>().</p>
      <pre>public ActionForward execute(ActionMapping mapping,<br />ActionForm form, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)<br />throws Exception {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; saveToken(request);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ....<br />}</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use <em>html:form</em> to create your form on your JSP (ex. <em>editBook.jsp</em>).</strong>
      </p>
      <pre>&lt;html:form action="..."&gt;<br />...<br />&lt;/html:form&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Check <em>isTokenValid</em>() and call <em>resetToken</em>().</strong> In the action class/method that handles the saving of your form (ex. <em>SaveBookAction</em>), you need to call <em>isTokenValid</em>(). If the token is valid, then you need to call <em>resetToken</em>().</p>
      <pre>public ActionForward execute(ActionMapping mapping,<br />ActionForm form, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)<br />throws Exception {<br />...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if ( !isTokenValid(request) ) {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return mapping.findForward(Constants.INVALID_TOKEN);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; } else {<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;//normal business logic<br />&amp;nbsp;...<br />&amp;nbsp;resetToken(request);<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }<br />...</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Using these 3 simple steps you can effectively have a session specific per user token used to validate that a request was submitted by a user intentionally.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: There have been effective attacks against various CSRF prevention techniques including this token-based approach when an application has XSS vulnerabilities. Removing XSS is therefore viewed as a prerequisite activity for a complete CSRF prevention mechanism.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, CSRF prevention can function as a strong security control if used properly and applied thoroughly throughout the application. The Struts framework provides a simple series of steps for accomplishing this task.</p>

* iOS applications that open saved files or documents.

==What to Check For==

Verify that file formats are validated.

==Why==

Many vulnerabilities are exploited via malformed documents supplied to the application. One particular vector of attack that is frequently used is embedding malformed documents in web pages - some applications are integrated into the web browser and will open malicious documents automatically in that scenario. Making sure that file format is valid before loading files into the application makes it harder to embed exploit code into documents.

==How to Check==

Identify the functions that open data files. Verify that these functions include provisions for validating the input data file format before passing it on to other functions.

==How to Fix==

Perform the following actions to validate file format before loading files into the application:

# **Define the file format.** Specify valid values for all possible fields in all document types used by your applications. This information should be a part of project documentation and the developers may already have it.
# **Review code.** Search for code that loads saved files into the application. Examine the extents of the validation already being performed by the application. If some validation is already being performed, some code may be recycled for a more thorough validation routine.
# **Implement validation.** Write validation functions for all fields in all document types supported by the application.
# **Centralize validation.** Move the validation functions for all document fields to the centralized input and data validation class or library. Write a master file format validation function that calls all individual data field validation functions.
# **Use validation.** Go back to code that loads data files into the application. Remove any old validation code. Add code that calls the master file format validation function on all files being loaded before loading them into the application.

Verify that data passed to //UIWebView// controls is validated and encoded.

==Why==

Validating data passed to //UIWebView// controls helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. //UIWebView// controls are capable of executing JavaScript passed to them. If unvalidated data is passed to //UIWebView// controls, it may be possible for an attacker to pass malicious JavaScript, which will then be executed in the context of the application.

==How to Check==

To verify that data passed to //UIWebView// controls is validated and encoded:

# **Identify data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Examine the application design and identify what types of data are handled by //UIWebView// controls, if any.
# **Identify code that passes data to //UIWebView// controls.** Review code to identify all //UIWebView// controls used by the application and code that passes data that may include JavaScript to them. Trouble areas may be found by searching for //stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString// method calls.
# **Identify and review validation code for data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Make sure there are validation methods for each type of data that is passed to //UIWebView// controls. Pay particular attention to any data that may include JavaScript.
# **Identify and review encoding code for data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Make sure there are encoding methods for each context of data that is passed to //UIWebView// controls. Unfortunately, there appear to be no standard libraries that handle encoding for iOS. Things to watch out for are: converting data to the same character-encoding before validating or encoding, escaping HTML entities, escaping JavaScript entities, and escaping XML entities, depending on context.
# **Verify that validation and encoding are performed on all data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Make sure that all data passed to //UIWebView// controls is validated and encoded.

==How to Fix==

To validate data passed to //UIWebView// controls:

# **Identify data passed to //UIWebView// controls.** Examine the application design and identify what types of data are handled by //UIWebView// controls, if any.

Verify that data inserted into XML documents is validated and encoded.

==Why==

Validating and encoding data inserted into XML documents helps prevent XML injection vulnerabilities.

==How to Check==

To verify that data inserted into XML documents is validated and encoded:

# **Identify XML documents used by the application.** Examine the application design to identify all XML documents and XML document types used by the application.
# **Identify code that uses XML documents.** Review application code to find code that uses XML documents.
# **Review validation code.** Make sure there are clear validation functions defined for each type of XML data handled by the application.
# **Review encoding code.** Make sure there are encoding functions defined for XML data. Consider the following when evaluating XML encoding: data has to be converted to a uniform character encoding first, XML entities have to be escaped properly, and code that loads XML documents should be able to restore the original data from the encoded data.
# **Verify that validation and encoding are used.** Make sure that all XML data is validated and encoded before being inserted into XML documents.

==How to Fix==

To validate and encode data inserted into XML documents:

# **Identify XML documents used by the application.** Examine the application design to identify all XML documents and XML document types used by the application.
# **Identify code that uses XML documents.** Review application code to find code that uses XML documents.
# **Add data validation code.** Add methods that validate all the data types that are stored in XML documents and used by the application.
# **Use validation code.** Add code that uses the data validation methods from the previous step to code that uses XML documents. Validation should be performed before encoding.
# **Add encoding code.** Add methods that escape XML entities. Unfortunately, there are no stable libraries available for escaping XML entities for iOS. When writing code that escapes XML entities, consider the following: data has to be converted to a uniform character encoding first, XML entities have to be escaped properly, and code that loads XML documents should be able to restore the original data from the encoded data.
# **Use encoding code.** Add code that encodes data to code that uses XML documents.

Verify that all input is validated.

==Why==

Properly implemented input validation is effective at preventing many types of injection vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting and SQL injection.

==How to Check==

To verify that all input is validated:

# **Identify all entry points for user input.** Make a list of all possible sources of user input in your application.
# **Identify all types on input accepted by the application.** For each source of user input on the list, define valid characters, length, format, and range (for numerical values).
# **Trace data from source to sink.** Trace each source of input through your application until you find its ultimate destination.  The final sink may be in memory, on the hard drive, sent over the network or stored in a database.
# **Inspect the input validation subsystem.** Each input source should have a data validation routine associated with it. Ideally the validation will occur as soon after the input reaches your application as possible. Shared validation routines are better than creating many spread throughout your code base, check for consolidation of routines to aid testing and reduce the chance of one-off bugs. If an input source does not have a validation routine associated with it, flag it for fixing. 
# **Ensure quality of validation routines.** Make sure that each validator verifies the characters, length, format, and range (for numerical values) of the respective type of input. Validation should check first for known valid and safe data and then for malicious, dangerous data. Do not rely on filtering out all malicious data, it is too easy to miss something.

==How to Fix==

To validate all user input using white-list input validation:

# **Identify all entry points for user input.** Make a list of all possible sources of user input in your application.
# **Identify all types on input accepted by the application.** For each source of user input on the list, define valid characters, length, format, and range (for numerical values).
# **Define an input validation subsystem.** Define a set of validator functions that should be used to validate each type of input handled by the application. Input should be validated on the server.
# **Validate characters.** Restrict the acceptable range of characters in text input by using regular expressions.
# **Validate length.** Add code to check that the length of the user input is valid.
# **Validate format.** If the input type has a specific pattern, such as a date or a phone number, add code to use regular expressions to make sure user input matches the input type specified by the application. Use regular expressions to enforce strong password requirements.
# **Validate range.** Restrict the acceptable range of numerical input by comparing the input to the maximum and minimum acceptable values.
# **(Optional) Reject and respond to known bad input.** This step does not add much actual security, but it is included here to let you know that such an option exists. The input validation subsystem may check for known attack strings and respond to these likely attacks by alerting the user. The options for responding to invalid input are: reject invalid input, log invalid input, take evasive action.
# **(Optional) Encode input.** If the input is going to be displayed back through the web application, consider adding code to encode it to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

      <Data><![CDATA[==Applies To==

* iOS applications that send or receive sensitive data over the network.

==What to Check For==

Verify that strong SSL configurations are used.

==Why==

Using strong SSL configurations prevents eavesdropping and other man-in-the-middle attacks. iOS SSL configurations are relatively strong by default, depending on the SDK version, and need to be intentionally degraded to be unsafe. Unfortunately, many developers degrade iOS SSL strength for compatibility with the development environments and subsequently do not restore the SSL configuration to the secure defaults in the production releases.

==How to Check==

To verify that strong SSL configurations are used:

# **Verify that self-signed certificates are disabled.** Search application code for the presence of the //continueWithoutCredentialForAuthenticationChallenge// selector - the presence of this selector indicates that self-signed SSL certificates may be allowed.
# **Check the available SDK version.** Identify the iOS SDK version used by the application. Versions 5 and higher of the iOS SDK may be considered to use strong SSL cypher suites. There are no practical ways to control which cypher suites are used by iOS applications. If strength of SSL cyphers is a critical requirement, use version 5 or higher of the iOS SDK.

==How to Fix==

To use strong SSL configurations:

# **Disable self-signed certificates.** Self-signed certificates are disabled by default by the iOS SDK. Developers have to intentionally enable self-signed certificates for them to be acceptable by the application. Self-signed certificates are often enabled for testing in the development environment. It is important to disable self-signed certificates in production releases, because self-signed certificates allow man-in-the-middle attacks, which largely negate the use of SSL.
# **Identify the available SDK version.** Identify the iOS SDK version used by the application.
# **Use strong cypher suites.** The cypher suites used by SSL implementations in iOS SDKs vary by version. Versions 5 and higher of the iOS SDK may be considered to use strong SSL cypher suites. There are no practical ways to control which cypher suites are used by iOS applications. If strength of SSL cyphers is a critical requirement, use version 5 or higher of the iOS SDK.

==Why==

An attacker that can control the contents of a format string may be able to execute arbitrary code.

Perform the following actions to assure that user input is not used in format strings:

# **Identify code that uses formatted input-output functions.** The following is a list of formatted input-output functions:

==What to Check For==

Verify that SSL is used to protect network connections.

==Why==

Properly using SSL to encrypt network communications prevents eavesdropping attacks. Other types of Man-in-the-middle attacks may also be prevented by using SSL.

==How to Check==

To verify that SSL is used to protect network connections:

# **Identify all communications performed by the application.** Review the application design to identify all network communications that are performed by the application.
# **Review communication security requirements.** Examine which network communications need to be encrypted. All transmissions that include sensitive data should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.
# **Identify code that uses the network.** Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.
# **Verify that SSL is used to protect network connections.** Examine code that is responsible for network connections that need to be encrypted and make sure that it uses SSL.

==How to Fix==

To use SSL to protect network connections:

# **Identify all communications performed by the application.** Review the application design to identify all network communications that are performed by the application.
# **Define communication security requirements.** Define which network communications need to be encrypted. All transmissions that include sensitive data should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.
# **Identify code that uses the network.** Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.
# **Add code that uses SSL.** Add code that uses SSL to code that performs network communications that need to be encrypted. The //NSURLRequest// and //NSURLConnection// classes support SSL with an acceptably secure default configuration starting with iOS 5 - this is the most practical way to use SSL on iOS and should be sufficient for most applications.

* iOS applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Check For==

Verify that authentication is implemented on the server-side.

==Why==

Server-side authentication should be used because client-side authentication is trivial to bypass.

==How to Check==

To verify that authentication is implemented on the server-side:

# **Review authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication controls as pertaining to your application:
#* Enforcing password strength requirements.
#* Allowing secure password reset or recovery.
#* Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.
#* Using multi-factor authentication.
#* Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.
#* Using SSL/TLS to secure communications.
#* Throttling repeated authentication attempts.
#* Locking inactive authentication accounts.
# **Identify authentication code.** Identify the code that is responsible for authentication both on the iOS device and on the remote server.
# **Review authentication code.** Examine authentication code to find where the actual security controls are implemented.
# **Verify that authentication is implemented on the server.** Make sure that sufficient security controls to satisfy authentication requirements are implemented on the server-side.


==How to Fix==

To implement authentication on the server-side:

# **Define authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication controls as pertaining to your application:
#* Enforcing password strength requirements.
#* Allowing secure password reset or recovery.
#* Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.
#* Using multi-factor authentication.
#* Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.
#* Using SSL/TLS to secure communications.
#* Throttling repeated authentication attempts.
#* Locking inactive authentication accounts.
# **Implement authentication on the server.** It is important to implement security controls, such as authentication on the server, because client-side security controls can be tampered with or disabled altogether on the client. Implement authentication controls that match the requirements defined in the previous step on the server back-end. 
# **Add client-side code that authenticates to the server.** Once authentication is implemented in accordance with the requirements, add client-side code that authenticates to the server. The client-side code will need an interface for managing authentication credentials, network code that communicates with the server using SSL/TLS, a token or some other means to maintain a session state on the server, and possibly secure storage for cached authentication credentials.

*iOS applications that access resources on a remote server.

==What to Check For==

Verify that role-based access control is used.

==Why==

Application roles allow administrators to group users into categories that need the same level of privileges. The mechanism provides an easy and clear way to discover and manage the least privileges necessary for the execution of a given task. It provides a more robust and flexible way of managing the application's users.

==How to Check==

To verify that role-based access control is used:

# **Understand the different types of users.** Enumerate the different types of users needed for the application. Understand how they will use the application and to which resources they will need access. Create a matrix mapping the actions each role is authorized to perform with the corresponding system components. Use this matrix to identify the different types of users according to the functionality they need. Creating a threat model may be a useful step to ensure that you correctly understand the implications of this matrix.
# **Verify that roles have been defined.** Determine which resources can be accessed by each role.
# **Verify that access control is implemented.** Examine code that accesses each type of resources to make sure that it performs access control checks before accessing the resource.
# **Verify that access control enforces defined roles.** Examine the code that performs access control checks to make sure that it enforces the defined roles.

==How to Fix==

Use the following steps when designing role-based security:

# **Understand the different types of users.** Enumerate the different types of users needed for the application. Understand how they will use the application and to which resources they will need access. Create a matrix mapping the actions each role is authorized to perform with the corresponding system components. Use this matrix to identify the different types of users according to the functionality they need. Creating a threat model may be a useful step to ensure that you correctly understand the implications of this matrix.
# **Establish the roles.** Define which resources can be accessed by each role. There are two approaches when enforcing role-based security - programmatic and declarative.
#* **The programmatic approach.** The programmatic approach to role-based security is written inside the code and provides additional runtime flexibility. It allows your application to dynamically create and assign roles so that user privileges can be granted and revoked without the need of restarting your application. When using the programmatic approach to role-based security, place access control checks at the appropriate locations in your application.
#* **The declarative approach.** The declarative approach to role-based security is done via the configuration files. It allows easy manageability as the declarations can be modified without having to recompile. By using the declarative approach, you can easily manage the security settings for large portions of the application without changing the source code.
# **Manage the users.** Assign the users into their respective user roles. The application should enforce the security policy according to the user roles instead of the actual user.

* iOS applications that use SQL databases.

==What to Check For==

Verify that parameterized methods are used for database access.

==Why==

Using parameterized methods for database access helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

==How to Check==

To verify that parameterized methods are used for database access:

# **Identify all code that executes SQL queries.** Review application code to find all queries that are executed by the application and the code that executes them.
# **Verify that parameterized APIs are used to execute SQL queries.** Make sure that data is passed to queries as parameters. Make sure that data, especially untrusted data, is never concatenated with the query strings and then executed.

==How to Fix==

To use parameterized methods for local database access:

# **Identify the APIs used for SQL database access.** The most common library for SQL database access in iOS applications is SQLite.
# **Identify available parameterized SQL access APIs.** Research the APIs for executing queries provided by the API used in your application and choose ones that separate SQL commands and data. The dangerous APIs are the ones that accept SQL queries as strings - they should be avoided. For SQLite, the statements and the data must first be converted to UTF-8 or UTF-16 character encodings. In SQLite, the way to use parameterized queries is to use prepared statements and pass data as parameters. The //sqlite3_prepare//, //sqlite3_prepare_v2//, //sqlite3_prepare16//, and //sqlite3_prepare16_v2// functions allow creating prepared statements. After a statement is prepared, variables are bound to it using //sqlite3_bind_*// functions. After variables have been bound, the query is executed using the //sqlite3_step// function as many times as necessary to get the full resultant data set - each call to //sqlite3_step// produces one row. The query can be reset by using the //sqlite3_reset// function - this resets the query result pointer to zero, so that //sqlite3_step// would start from the first resultant row again. After database access is complete, the query and its result should be destroyed using the //sqlite3_finalize// function.
# **Identify code that executes SQL queries.** Examine application code to find code that executes SQL queries.
# **Use parameterized APIs to execute SQL queries.** Make sure that parameterized queries are used by code that executes SQL queries. Rewrite existing code if necessary or add code that uses parameterized queries to perform database access. 

There is no practical way to access remote SQL databases using native iOS API calls, so the most common way to access remote SQL databases from iOS applications is by writing a Web Service wrapper for the database server. To use parameterized methods for remote database access:

# **Set up a Web Service back-end server.** Choose a platform for deploying the Web Services back-end and configure the server appropriately. One of the most common solutions is to use an ASP.NET back-end, because ASP.NET is well suited for developing Web Services.
# **Write the Web Service code.** Implement the necessary Web Services on the platform of your choice.
# **Use parameterized APIs to execute SQL queries.** When implementing the Web Services, make sure to use parameterized APIs for database access to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
# **Connect the application to the back-end.** Add code to the iOS application to interact with the back-end. It might be necessary to add some pages for configuring the connection to the back-end, such as setting the URL of the Web Services and the authentication credentials.

* iOS applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Check For==

Verify that authentication attempts are throttled.

==Why==

Throttling authentication attempts makes password guessing attacks less effective. Authentication throttling should be implemented on the server to be effective.

==How to Check==

To verify that authentication attempts are throttled:

# **Review authentication throttling requirements.** Determine the time-out period between each authentication attempt. A recommended time-out period is three seconds.
# **Identify authentication code.** Identify server-side code that is responsible for authentication.
# **Review authentication code.** Examine authentication code to make sure that repeated authentication attempts are throttled. Verify that log entries are generated that indicate multiple repeated failed authentication attempts. Make sure the application keeps track of clients that attempt to authenticate using IPs and session cookies.
# **Attempt logging into the application repeatedly.** Test authentication throttling by attempting to log in repeatedly and observing that there is a pause between being allowed to attempt to authenticate again.


==How to Fix==

To throttle authentication attempts:

# **Define authentication throttling requirements.** Define the time-out period between each authentication attempt. A recommended time-out period is three seconds.
# **Identify authentication code.** Identify server-side code that is responsible for authentication.
# **Add code that throttles authentication attempts.** Add server-side code to the authentication code identified in the previous step to wait for the required time period before handling another authentication request. Keep track of clients using IPs and session cookies to make it harder to bypass authentication throttling.

      <Data><![CDATA[==What to Check For==

Verify that cached authentication data is stored in the //keychain//.

==Why==

Authentication credentials and encryption keys should be stored in the //keychain//, because the //keychain// encrypts data that is stored in it and is designed for storing such information. The //keychain// is also suitable for storing application configuration settings. It is usually best not to store sensitive data if it can be avoided, but sometimes usability requirements demand that the user be able to save authentication credentials for future use; in that case authentication credentials should be stored in the //keychain//.

==How to Check==

To verify that cached authentication data is stored in the //keychain//:

# **Identify cached authentication data.** Make a list of types of cached authentication data used by your application. Some examples are:
#* Passwords
#* Certificates
#* Encryption keys
#* Authentication tokens
# **Identify the code that caches authenticaton data.** Review the application code to find all code that handles data that should be stored in the //keychain//.
# **Verify that cached authentication data is stored in the //keychain//.** Examine code that handles cached authentication data to make sure that it uses the //keychain// for storage.

#* Certificates
#* Encryption keys

# **Define encryption requirements for sensitive data that is stored in files.** Choose the level of protection that is the most appropriate for each type of sensitive data handled by the application that is stored in files. The iOS Data Protection API provides the following protection levels:
#* //FileProtectionNone// - no encryption.
#* //FileProtectionComplete// - encrypt the file and deny access when the device is locked.
#* //FileProtectionCompleteUnlessOpen// - encrypt the file until it is open, leave it decrypted while it is open even if the device is locked.
#* //FileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication// - encrypt the file until the device is unlocked for the first time after a reboot.
# **Define encryption requirements for sensitive data that is stored in the keychain.** Choose the level of protection that is the most appropriate for each type of sensitive data handled by the application that is stored in the keychain. The keychain provides the following protection levels:
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleAlways// - the item is always available.
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked// - the item is only available when the device is unlocked.
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock// - the item is only available after the device is unlocked for the first time after a reboot.
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleAlwaysThisDeviceOnly// - the item is always available, but is not moved to other devices.
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly// - the item is only available when the device is unlocked and is not moved to other devices.
#* //kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly// - the item is only available after the device is unlocked for the first time after a reboot and is not moved to other devices.
# **Identify the code that caches authenticaton data.** Review the application code to find all code that handles data that should be stored in the //keychain//.

Verify that applications are signed.

==Why==

Cryptographically signing applications assures that the application binary has not been tampered with and that it came from a trusted source. Applications have to be signed with a trusted certificate to run on iOS.

==How to Check==

If applications are not signed properly, they will not run. To verify that an application is signed:

# **Install the application.** Follow the standard procedure to install the application. Usually, this means installing the application via iTunes.
# **Run the application.** Once the application is installed, launch it from the Springboard. If the application runs, then it has been signed successfully.

==How to Fix==

The iOS application signing process is complicated, but it is also well documented by Apple. To sign iOS applications:

# **Prepare the application for the release.** Build the application in release mode. Remove or disable any development settings or code from the application. Disable support for self-signed SSL certificates if it has been enabled. Disable generation of log entries that were used for debugging. Disable file sharing by default if the application supports it. Make sure the default application settings are secure. Make sure the application does not use any private iOS APIs.
# **Create a distribution provisioning profile.** You have to be a member of the iOS Developer Program to publish iOS applications. Once you have an account, you can go to the iOS Dev Center and submit requests for provisioning profiles. Download the new distribution profile.
# **Install the distribution provisioning profile.** Double-click the downloaded distribution profile and it should be added to Xcode.
# **Create an application archive.** Build your application and create the .ipa file. Make sure that Xcode is configured to build the application in release mode and using the correct distribution profile.
# **Examine the application record in iTunes Connect.** Go to iTunes connect and fill out the forms to create the application record, if necessary.
# **Submit the application for publication.** Go to //Product//, //Archive// in XCode and follow on-screen instructions to submit the application for approval.
# **Wait for approval notification.** The e-mail account associated with the iOS Developer Program account should receive a notification regarding the status of the approval process. This might take a week or more, but after it is finished, the application should be signed and ready for distribution.

Verify that application updates are signed.

==Why==

Application updates should be signed to verify that they came from a trusted source. In practice, updates to iOS applications are distributed as full new versions rather than patches. iOS application updates have to be signed to run, just like entirely new applications have to be signed. 

==How to Check==

Updated applications will not run if they are not signed properly. To verify that an application update is signed:

# **Install the application update.** Follow the standard procedure to install the application update. Usually, this means installing the application update via iTunes.
# **Run the application.** Once the application update is installed, launch the application from the Springboard. If the application runs, then the update has been signed successfully.

Verify that a secure password reset function is implemented.

==Why==

Password reset and recovery features are important to prevent locking out of users that forgot their passwords, however they also present a security challenge. An attacker might try to compromise user passwords by abusing the password recovery or reset functions and these functions by definition need to be accessible to unauthenticated users, so they require particular diligence in being protected. 

==How to Check==

To verify that a secure password reset function has been implemented:

# **Make sure that password resetting is implemented.** Review the application authentication mechanism to make sure that password resetting is implemented. Password reset is preferable to recovery - if an attacker manages to change the user's password, the user should be able to notice that a compromise has taken place.
# **Check if password resetting is implemented on the server.** Examine the code that implements password resetting to make sure that security controls guarding it are implemented on the server.
# **Check if user identity is verified during the reset.** Test the password reset functionality to make sure that the user's identity is verified sufficiently during the reset.
# **Verify that a side channel is used to send password reset tokens.** Test the password reset functionality to make sure that the password reset tokens are sent using a side channel, such as the e-mail address associated with the username for which the password reset is requested. A side channel is a way to communicate information other than the one that is used to request the password reset, so if the password reset is requested via a web page, an e-mail message would be a side channel.

==How to Fix==

To implement a secure password reset function:

# **Implement password resetting on the server.** Most of the password resetting functionality should be implemented on the server. The iOS application might need a button on the login page for requesting a password reset.
# **Verify user identity.** The exact method for verifying user identity should be specific to the application and  based on the types of information available about the user and the security requirements. User identity is often established by asking security questions that are associated with the account and proceeding with the reset only if the correct answer is provided. At the very least, the application should ask for the e-mail address associated with the user account for which the password reset is requested.
# **Use a side channel to send a password reset token.** The most common and effective solution is to send a difficult to predict token to the e-mail address associated with the user account for which the password reset is requested.
# **Provide a control for changing the password.** Once the user has the password reset token, there should be a way for the user to submit that token and to then be able to change the password. One way is to provide a web page that does this, another is to provide a Web Service to the iOS application that accepts the password reset token and allows the user to change the password; both methods may be used in combination.
# **Log the password reset event.** Both failed and successful password reset requests should be logged on the server. A large amount of password reset requests may indicate an attack.

#* Encryption keys
#* Personal information
# **Identify sensitive data storage locations.** Sensitive data may be stored in the following locations:

Verify that authentication credentials sent over the network are encrypted.

==Why==

Encrypting authentication credentials sent over the network helps prevent various man-in-the-middle attacks, such as spoofing or hijacking.

==How to Check==

To verify that authentication credentials are encrypted when sent over the network:

# **Identify the authentication mechanism used by the application.** Most applications use usernames and passwords for authentication, however there are other options available, such as certificates. 
# **Identify the authentication code.** Identify the code that is responsible for authentication both on the iOS device and on the remote server. The authentication itself should be implemented on the server. To protect authentication credentials in transit, both end points need to support SSL.
# **Review authentication code.** Examine authentication code to make sure that it uses SSL to send authentication credentials.
# **Inspect packet captures.** Use a tool such as //Wireshark// to capture packets sent by the application during authentication. Inspect the captured packets to make sure that authentication credentials are not sent in plain-text.

==How to Fix==

To encrypt authentication credentials sent over the network:

# **Identify the authentication mechanism used by the application.** Most applications use usernames and passwords for authentication, however there are other options available, such as certificates. 
# **Identify the authentication code.** Identify the code that is responsible for authentication both on the iOS device and on the remote server. The authentication itself should be implemented on the server. To protect authentication credentials in transit, both end points need to support SSL. 
# **Encrypt authentication credentials in transit.** Add code that uses SSL to protect authentication credentials in transit. The server should be configured to only accept authentication credentials via SSL. The iOS //NSURLRequest// and //NSURLConnection// classes support SSL and should be sufficient for many common authentication scenarios.

      <Data><![CDATA[==What to Check For==

Verify that freed objects are not referenced.

==Why==

Accessing memory that has been deallocated may result in an exploitable vulnerability. This type of vulnerability is called a "dangling pointer vulnerability". The unallocated memory is accessed via a pointer that has been used to free the memory earlier - this pointer is the "dangling pointer".

==How to Check==

To verify that freed objects are not referenced:

# **Search for deallocation code.** Review code to find all places where memory is being deallocated.
# **Verify that deallocation code is close to exit points.** Make sure that deallocation code is close to the end of the respective functions - this makes it easier to manage deallocation and prevent double-free vulnerabilities.
# **Review deallocation code.** Examine deallocation code to make sure that objects are only freed once.

==How to Fix==

Write code in such a way that guarantees that pointers are not used after memory that they point to has been deallocated. One way to do this is to deallocate memory at the end of functions, so that there is no code that accesses memory after it has been deallocated. Perform the following actions to assure that unallocated memory is not accessed:

# **Search for deallocation code.** Review code to find all places where memory is being deallocated.
# **Move deallocation code.** Place deallocation code right before exit points of the function. Set pointers to null. Make sure that deallocated pointers are not being used elsewhere in the application.

* iOS applications that send or receive sensitive data over the network.

==What to Check For==

Verify that self-signed SSL certificates are disabled.

==Why==

Allowing the use of self-signed SSL certificates enables some types of man-in-the-middle attacks.

==How to Check==

To verify that self-signed SSL certificates are disabled:

# **Search for code that allows self-signed SSL certificates.** Search application code for the presence of the //continueWithoutCredentialForAuthenticationChallenge// selector - the presence of this selector indicates that self-signed SSL certificates may be allowed.
# **Verify that self-signed SSL certificates are not allowed in production releases.** If self-signed SSL certificates are allowed for development purposes, make sure that they are disabled in production releases. The recommended way to disable development code in production releases is by using //#define// and //#ifdef// compiler directives.

==How to Fix==

Self-signed SSL certificates are not allowed by default. Do not allow them. Avoid using the //allowsAnyHTTPSCertificateForHost// method in production releases, because it allows self-signed SSL certificates. Do not use the //continueWithoutCredentialForAuthenticationChallenge// selector within the //didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge// delegate method of //NSURLConnection// objects, because it enables self-signed SSL certificates.

==How to Fix==

There are two common ways to parse XML in iOS: //NSXMLParser// and //LibXML2//. 

# **//NSXMLParser//.** Parsing of external entities is disabled by default in //NSXMLParser//. Don't explicitly enable parsing of external entities - avoid using the //setShouldResolveExternalEntities// option.

Disable file sharing to prevent unauthorized access. Some applications share all the user's files by default. If file sharing is necessary, it should only be enabled when it is being used.

==How to Check==

To verify that file sharing is disabled:

# **Identify applications with file sharing capabilities.** Enumerate all the installed applications. Check each application to see if it supports file sharing.
# **Verify that file sharing is disabled.** Examine application settings to make sure that file sharing is disabled.
# **Verify that file sharing is disabled by default.** When developing applications, check the default settings to make sure that file sharing is disabled by default.

==How to Fix==

To disable file sharing in applications that support it:

# **Identify applications with file sharing capabilities.** Enumerate all the installed applications. Check each application to see if it supports file sharing.
# **Disable or secure file sharing.** Disable file sharing for each application that enables such functionality when file sharing is not being used. If the application offers security features to protect file sharing, such as password protection, use these features to protect file sharing. Even if security features are available for file sharing, file sharing should be disabled when it is not being used.
# **Disable file sharing by default.** When developing applications, disable file sharing by default in your applications.

* iOS applications where Obj-C code passes file names and paths to C code.

==What to Check For==

Verify that file paths and names are checked for null bytes.

==Why==

Checking file names and paths for null bytes helps prevent unauthorized file access. Code written in C uses null bytes to terminate strings. If a string containing null bytes is passed to C code, the C code will only usually see the part until the first null byte. Attackers often use this quality to be able to access unintended files by inserting null bytes in file names. Objective-C //NSString// objects are not terminated by null bytes, so an attacker may use them to pass paths and names containing null bytes to native C code.

==How to Check==

To verify that file paths and names are checked for null bytes:

# **Identify all input used for file access.** Enumerate all file access performed by the application. Examine code responsible for accessing each file. Take note of any input used to form path or file names for file access.
# **Verify that null bytes are removed from paths.** If a //NSString// object contains a file name or path and includes a null byte, an incorrect resource may be accessed. Make sure there is code that checks //NSString// objects for null bytes before passing them to native C code.


==How to Fix==

To check file paths and names for null bytes:
# **Identify all input used for file access.** Enumerate all file access performed by the application. Examine code responsible for accessing each file. Take note of any input used to form path or file names for file access.
# **Remove null bytes from paths.** If a //NSString// object contains a file name or path and includes a null byte, an incorrect resource may be accessed. Verify that there are no null bytes in strings that are used for file names or paths. If null bytes are detected, it is safer to abort the operation than to strip the null bytes, because the presence of null bytes almost certainly indicates an attack.

==Why==

Code integrity checks help prevent software piracy and unauthorized modifications to the application. Code integrity checks do not provide 100% assurance of code integrity. Code integrity checks make it harder for an attacker to modify the application binary code without breaking it.

==How to Check==

To verify that code integrity checks are implemented:

# **Identify piracy check functions.** It's best if someone knows if piracy checks exist and where they are, otherwise it might be necessary to examine each function individually to determine its purpose.
# **Identify integrity check functions.** It's best if someone knows if integrity checks exist and where they are, otherwise it might be necessary to examine each function individually to determine its purpose.
# **Verify that integrity check functions protect piracy check functions.** Find calls to the piracy check functions and make sure that integrity check functions are also called to make sure that piracy check functions have not been tampered with.
# **Verify that piracy check and integrity check functions are scattered throughout the application.** Find calls to the piracy and integrity check functions to make sure they are called multiple times throughout the application.


==How to Fix==

To check code for integrity:

# **Write piracy check functions.** One common way to check if the application is not licensed properly is to check if the device is jailbroken. While a jailbroken device does not necessarily mean the application has been pirated, there are no fool-proof anti-piracy or code integrity measures for jailbroken devices. Some common ways to check for jailbroken devices are to check for the existence of files that only appear on jailbroken devices, such as Cydia. If piracy is not a concern, this step may be omitted.
# **Write integrity check functions.** The most common ways for implementing code integrity checks are by checking classes for expected addresses or checksums. The //class_getMethodImplementation// method returns a pointer a method; checking the value of this pointer against the expected value provides reasonable assurance that the method has not been modified during runtime.
# **Define integrity check functions as inline.** The integrity check functions written in the previous step should be defined as //inline// so that the compiler inserts the full integrity checking code wherever it is invoked.
# **Scatter integrity check functions throughout the application.** Multiple integrity checking functions spread out throughout the application make it harder for an attacker to find them all and patch them.

Verify that root passwords have been changed on jailbroken devices.

==Why==

Changing the root password prevents unauthorized parties from being able to connect to the device remotely via SSH using the default authentication credentials. The default root password in iOS is "alpine". Jailbroken devices often run SSH by default and allow root users to login. If the default root password is not changed, attackers may be able to access the device remotely with super-user privileges and manage files or execute commands.

==How to Check==

To verify that root passwords have been changed on jailbroken devices:

# **Identify the IP of the jailbroken device.** There are many different ways to identify the IP of a jailbroken device. One of the simplest ways is to connect the device to a WiFi network and check its IP from the Settings application. After the device is connected to a WiFi network, go to //Settings -> Wi-Fi -> [name of your network here]// and you will see the IP Address assigned to the device.
# **SSH into the jailbroken device.** Use your SSH client of choice to connect to the iDevice using the IP identified in the earlier step. Attempt authenticating using the username //root// and the password //alpine//. If authentication is successful with these credentials, the default root password has not been changed.

==How to Fix==

There are multiple ways for changing the root passwords on jailbroken devices, but they usually require a command line interface. One common approach is to use the MobileTerminal program, which is available from Cydia. MobileTerminal is not installed by default, however. SSH is usually installed by default and enabled on jailbroken devices. To use SSH to change the root password on a jailbroken device:

# **Identify the IP of the jailbroken device.** There are many different ways to identify the IP of a jailbroken device. One of the simplest ways is to connect the device to a WiFi network and check its IP from the Settings application. After the device is connected to a WiFi network, go to //Settings -> Wi-Fi -> [name of your network here]// and you will see the IP Address assigned to the device.
# **SSH into the jailbroken device.** Use your SSH client of choice to connect to the iDevice using the IP identified in the earlier step. The username is //root//. The password is //alpine//.
# **Change the root password.** Issue the following command to change the root password: {{{passwd}}}. You will be asked to enter the new password twice.

Verify that file names and paths are canonicalized.

==Why==

Canonicalizing file paths before validating them helps prevent unauthorized access. If a file path is not canonicalized, an attacker may use special characters to access resources outside of what is allowed by the application.

==How to Check==

To verify that file names and paths are canonicalized:

# **Identify all input used for file access.** Enumerate all file access performed by the application. Examine code responsible for accessing each file. Take note of any input used to form path or file names for file access.
# **Verify that null bytes are removed from paths.** If a file name or path includes a null byte, an incorrect resource may be accessed. Verify that there is code that checks for null bytes in strings that are used for file names or paths. If null bytes are detected, it is safer to abort the operation than to strip the null bytes, because the presence of null bytes almost certainly indicates an attack.
# **Verify that all input data used for file paths is canonicalized.** Examine code that handles file names and paths and make sure that it translates file paths and names into canonical forms before using the files. If file names or paths are hard-coded, they don't need to be canonicalized.
# **Verify that all file paths are validated.** Examine code that opens files to make sure that file names and paths are validated before being used. If file names or paths are hard-coded, they don't need to be validated.


==How to Fix==

To canonicalize file names and paths:

# **Identify all input used for file access.** Enumerate all file access performed by the application. Examine code responsible for accessing each file. Take note of any input used to form path or file names for file access.
# **Remove null bytes from paths.** If a file name or path includes a null byte, an incorrect resource may be accessed. Verify that there are no null bytes in strings that are used for file names or paths. If null bytes are detected, it is safer to abort the operation than to strip the null bytes, because the presence of null bytes almost certainly indicates an attack.
# **Canonicalize all input data used for file paths.** The exact approach for canonicalization is different for different applications. One common scenario is appending a user-specified file name to a predefined path. In that case, the //lastPathComponent// method of the //NSString// class should be used on the file name to get just the file name. After that, the file name should be added to the predefined path.
# **Validate file paths.** Verify that the user or application are authorized to access the specified resource.

Verify that URL handlers are not used for sensitive operations.

==Why==

URL handlers may be abused in Cross-Site Scripting attacks. If URL handlers are used for sensitive operations, such sensitive operations may be exploited in Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

==How to Check==

To verify that URL handlers are not used for sensitive operations:

# **Identify all URL handlers used by the application.** Examine the application .plist file for //URL Types// defined by the application. These //URL Types// correspond to URL handlers used by the application.
# **Identify the operations associated with the URL handlers.** The developers should know what each //URL Type// is responsible for. 
# **Verify that URL handlers are not used for sensitive operations.** Examine each URL handler to decide whether it is safe to keep. 
# **Verify that URL handlers validate the origin of the URL request.** For URL handlers that are necessary for the application, make sure the //openURL// method is used.


==How to Fix==

To avoid using URL handlers for sensitive operations:

# **Identify all URL handlers used by the application.** Examine the application .plist file for //URL Types// defined by the application. These //URL Types// correspond to URL handlers used by the application.
# **Identify the operations associated with the URL handlers.** The developers should know what each //URL Type// is responsible for. Consider each one and decide if it is safe to keep.
# **Remove dangerous URL handlers.** Sometimes URL handlers are used for testing. Remove any URL handlers that may be too dangerous from the production release.
# **Verify the origin of the URL request**. Use the //openURL// method to make sure the URL request came from within the application itself or from a trusted application for any remaining URL handlers.

Encrypt authentication credentials sent over the network. Using SSL is the simplest way to protect the authentication process.

==Why==

Encrypting authentication credentials sent over the network helps prevent various man-in-the-middle attacks, such as spoofing or hijacking.

==How==

To encrypt authentication credentials sent over the network:

# **Identify the authentication mechanism used by the application.** Most applications use usernames and passwords for authentication, however there are other options available, such as certificates. 
# **Identify the authentication code.** Identify the code that is responsible for authentication both on the iOS device and on the remote server. The authentication itself should be implemented on the server. To protect authentication credentials in transit, both end points need to support SSL. 
# **Encrypt authentication credentials in transit.** Add code that uses SSL to protect authentication credentials in transit.

* Android applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Do==

Implement a secure password reset function.

==Why==

Password reset and recovery features are important to prevent locking out of users that forgot their passwords, however they also present a security challenge. An attacker might try to compromise user passwords by abusing the password recovery or reset functions and these functions by definition need to be accessible to unauthenticated users, so they require particular diligence in being protected. Password reset is preferable to recovery - if an attacker manages to change the user's password, the user should be able to notice that a compromise has taken place.

==How==

To implement a secure password reset function:

# **Implement password resetting on the server.** Most of the password resetting functionality should be implemented on the server. The Android application might need a button on the login page for requesting a password reset.
# **Verify user identity.** The exact method for verifying user identity should be specific to the application and  based on the types of information available about the user and the security requirements. User identity is often established by asking security questions that are associated with the account and proceeding with the reset only if the correct answer is provided. At the very least, the application should ask for the e-mail address associated with the user account for which the password reset is requested.
# **Use a side channel to send a password reset token.** The most common and effective solution is to send a difficult to predict token to the e-mail address associated with the user account for which the password reset is requested.
# **Provide a control for changing the password.** Once the user has the password reset token, there should be a way for the user to submit that token and to then be able to change the password. One way is to provide a web page that does this, another is to provide a Web Service to the Android application that accepts the password reset token and allows the user to change the password; both methods may be used in combination.
# **Log the password reset event.** Both failed and successful password reset requests should be logged on the server. A large amount of password reset requests may indicate an attack.

*Android applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Do==

Throttle authentication attempts by making authentication code pause for a few seconds between each authentication request per IP.

==Why==

Throttle authentication attempts to make password guessing attacks less effective. Authentication throttling should be implemented on the server to be effective.

==How==

To throttle authentication attempts:

# **Define authentication throttling requirements.** Define the time-out period between each authentication attempt. A recommended time-out period is three seconds.
# **Identify authentication code.** Identify server-side code that is responsible for authentication.
# **Add code that throttles authentication attempts.** Add server-side code to the authentication code identified in the previous step to wait for the required time period before handling another authentication request. Keep track of clients using IPs and session cookies to make it harder to bypass authentication throttling.

* Android applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Do==

Use server-side authentication.

==Why==

Server-side authentication should be used because client-side authentication is trivial to bypass.

==How==

# **Define authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication controls as pertaining to your application:
#* Enforcing password strength requirements.
#* Allowing secure password reset or recovery.
#* Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.
#* Using multi-factor authentication.
#* Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.
#* Using SSL/TLS to secure communications.
#* Throttling repeated authentication attempts.
#* Locking inactive authentication accounts.
# **Implement authentication on the server.** It is important to implement security controls, such as authentication on the server, because client-side security controls can be tampered with or disabled altogether on the client. Implement authentication controls that match the requirements defined in the previous step on the server back-end. 
# **Add client-side code that authenticates to the server.** Once authentication is implemented in accordance with the requirements, add client-side code that authenticates to the server. The client-side code will need an interface for managing authentication credentials, network code that communicates with the server using SSL/TLS, a token or some other means to maintain a session state on the server, and possibly secure storage for cached authentication credentials.

* Android applications that access resources on a remote server.

==What to Do==

Enumerate the different types of users and create specific roles for them. When authorizing access to a resource, build the security checks on a per-role basis rather than on a per-user basis.

==Why==

Application roles allow administrators to group users into categories that need the same level of privileges. The mechanism provides an easy and clear way to discover and manage the least privileges necessary for the execution of a given task. It provides a more robust and flexible way of managing the application's users.

==How==

Use the following steps when designing role-based security:

# **Understand the different types of users.** Enumerate the different types of users needed for the application. Understand how they will use the application and to which resources they will need access. Create a matrix mapping the actions each role is authorized to perform with the corresponding system components. Use this matrix to identify the different types of users according to the functionality they need. Creating a threat model may be a useful step to ensure that you correctly understand the implications of this matrix.
# **Establish the roles.** Define which resources can be accessed by each role. There are two approaches when enforcing role-based security - programmatic and declarative.
#* **The programmatic approach.** The programmatic approach to role-based security is written inside the code and provides additional runtime flexibility. It allows your application to dynamically create and assign roles so that user privileges can be granted and revoked without the need of restarting your application. When using the programmatic approach to role-based security, place access control checks at the appropriate locations in your application.
#* **The declarative approach.** The declarative approach to role-based security is done via the configuration files. It allows easy manageability as the declarations can be modified without having to recompile. By using the declarative approach, you can easily manage the security settings for large portions of the application without changing the source code.
# **Manage the users.** Assign the users into their respective user roles. The application should enforce the security policy according to the user roles instead of the actual user.]]></Data>

# **Verify that a side channel is used to send password reset tokens.** Test the password reset functionality to make sure that the password reset tokens are sent using a side channel, such as the e-mail address associated with the username for which the password reset is requested. A side channel is a way to communicate information other than the one that is used to request the password reset, so if the password reset is requested via a web page, an e-mail message would be a side channel.

==How to Fix==

To implement a secure password reset function:

# **Implement password resetting on the server.** Most of the password resetting functionality should be implemented on the server. The Android application might need a button on the login page for requesting a password reset.
# **Verify user identity.** The exact method for verifying user identity should be specific to the application and  based on the types of information available about the user and the security requirements. User identity is often established by asking security questions that are associated with the account and proceeding with the reset only if the correct answer is provided. At the very least, the application should ask for the e-mail address associated with the user account for which the password reset is requested.
# **Use a side channel to send a password reset token.** The most common and effective solution is to send a difficult to predict token to the e-mail address associated with the user account for which the password reset is requested.
# **Provide a control for changing the password.** Once the user has the password reset token, there should be a way for the user to submit that token and to then be able to change the password. One way is to provide a web page that does this, another is to provide a Web Service to the Android application that accepts the password reset token and allows the user to change the password; both methods may be used in combination.
# **Log the password reset event.** Both failed and successful password reset requests should be logged on the server. A large amount of password reset requests may indicate an attack.

Disable parsing of external XML entities.

==Why==

Parsing external entities in XML documents may result in injection vulnerabilities.

==How==

There are multiple parsing packages built into the Android SDK: //SAXParser//, //XmlPullParser// and //DocumentBuilder//.

//DocumentBuilder// doesn't support external XML entities.

//XmlPullParser// doesn't support external XML entities.

//SAXParser// has parsing of external XML entities disabled by default. Parsing of external XML entities is configured in //SAXParser// using //external-general-entities// and //external-parameter-entities// feature flags. Please, make sure that these flags are not enabled by the application.

Verify that authentication credentials sent over the network are encrypted.

==Why==

Encrypting authentication credentials sent over the network helps prevent various man-in-the-middle attacks, such as spoofing or hijacking.

==How to Check==

To verify that authentication credentials are encrypted when sent over the network:

# **Identify the authentication mechanism used by the application.** Most applications use usernames and passwords for authentication, however there are other options available, such as certificates. 
# **Identify the authentication code.** Identify the code that is responsible for authentication both on the iOS device and on the remote server. The authentication itself should be implemented on the server. To protect authentication credentials in transit, both end points need to support SSL.
# **Review authentication code.** Examine authentication code to make sure that it uses SSL to send authentication credentials.
# **Inspect packet captures.** Use a tool such as //Wireshark// to capture packets sent by the application during authentication. Inspect the captured packets to make sure that authentication credentials are not sent in plain-text.

==How to Fix==

To encrypt authentication credentials sent over the network:

# **Identify the authentication mechanism used by the application.** Most applications use usernames and passwords for authentication, however there are other options available, such as certificates. 
# **Identify the authentication code.** Identify the code that is responsible for authentication both on the iOS device and on the remote server. The authentication itself should be implemented on the server. To protect authentication credentials in transit, both end points need to support SSL.

Verify that application updates are signed.

==Why==

Sign updates to the application to help verify that the updates came from a trusted party.

==How to Check==

Updated applications will not run if they are not signed properly. To verify that an application update is signed:

# **Install the application update.** Follow the standard procedure to install the application update. 
# **Run the application.** Once the application update is installed, launch the application. If the application runs, then the update has been signed successfully.

==How to Fix==

Signing updates is an important principle in software development to prevent malicious software from masquerading as updates to legitimate software. In practice, updates to mobile software are usually distributed as complete new versions, rather than as patches to the already installed software. The updated software package is usually signed because otherwise it won't be allowed on the most popular distribution channels. Therefore, the process for signing mobile software and updates is usually already established by software developers. It is still important to be aware of the importance of signing software and software updates.

Validate all user input by using white-list/positive input validation. White-list input validation means allowing only input that is explicitly defined as valid, as opposed to black-list input validation, which filters out known bad input.

==Why==

Properly implemented input validation is effective at preventing many types of injection vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting and SQL injection.

==How==

To validate all user input using white-list input validation:

# **Identify all entry points for user input.** Make a list of all possible sources of user input in your application.
# **Identify all types on input accepted by the application.** For each source of user input on the list, define valid characters, length, format, and range (for numerical values).
# **Define an input validation subsystem.** Define a set of validator functions that should be used to validate each type of input handled by the application. Input should be validated on the server.
# **Validate characters.** Restrict the acceptable range of characters in text input by using regular expressions.
# **Validate length.** Add code to check that the length of the user input is valid.
# **Validate format.** If the input type has a specific pattern, such as a date or a phone number, add code to use regular expressions to make sure user input matches the input type specified by the application. Use regular expressions to enforce strong password requirements.
# **Validate range.** Restrict the acceptable range of numerical input by comparing the input to the maximum and minimum acceptable values.
# **(Optional) Reject and respond to known bad input.** This step does not add much actual security, but it is included here to let you know that such an option exists. The input validation subsystem may check for known attack strings and respond to these likely attacks by alerting the user. The options for responding to invalid input are: reject invalid input, log invalid input, take evasive action.
# **(Optional) Encode input.** If the input is going to be displayed back through the web application, consider adding code to encode it to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

==What to Check For==

Verify that file formats are validated.

==Why==

Many vulnerabilities are exploited via malformed documents supplied to the application. One particular vector of attack that is frequently used is embedding malformed documents in web pages - some applications are integrated into the web browser and will open malicious documents automatically in that scenario. Making sure that file format is valid before loading files into the application makes it harder to embed exploit code into documents.

==How to Check==

Identify the functions that open data files. Verify that these functions include provisions for validating the input data file format before passing it on to other functions.

==How to Fix==

Perform the following actions to validate file format before loading files into the application:

# **Define the file format.** Specify valid values for all possible fields in all document types used by your applications. This information should be a part of project documentation and the developers may already have it.
# **Review code.** Search for code that loads saved files into the application. Examine the extents of the validation already being performed by the application. If some validation is already being performed, some code may be recycled for a more thorough validation routine.
# **Implement validation.** Write validation functions for all fields in all document types supported by the application.
# **Centralize validation.** Move the validation functions for all document fields to the centralized input and data validation class or library. Write a master file format validation function that calls all individual data field validation functions.
# **Use validation.** Go back to code that loads data files into the application. Remove any old validation code. Add code that calls the master file format validation function on all files being loaded before loading them into the application.

* Android applications that use SQL databases.

==What to Check For==

Verify that parameterized methods are used for database access.

==Why==

Using parameterized query methods for database access prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities.

==How to Check==

To verify that parameterized methods are used for database access:

# **Identify all code that executes SQL queries.** Review application code to find all queries that are executed by the application and the code that executes them.
# **Verify that parameterized APIs are used to execute SQL queries.** Make sure that data is passed to queries as parameters. Make sure that data, especially untrusted data, is never concatenated with the query strings and then executed.

==How to Fix==

The Android API includes parameterized functions for querying SQLite databases. Avoid using the rawQuery method, because it may be used in a manner that introduces SQL injection vulnerabilities, by including untrusted input in the SQL query string.

Use the following method for SELECT statements:

*//query//

Use the following methods for INSERT statements:

*//insert//
*//insertOrThrow//
*//insertWithOnConflict//

Use the following methods for UPDATE statements:

*//update//
*//updateWithOnConflict//

Use the following method for DELETE statements:

*//delete//

If your application uses some other API, please make sure that it uses parameterized methods for database access.

Verify that native code is not used unless necessary.

==Why==

Using native code increases the risk of memory management vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities.

==How to Check==

Examine application source code files to detect any code that is not written in Java. Java files typically have //.java// file extensions and C files usually have //.c// file extensions. The presence of file names ending with //.c// indicates that native code is present.

==How to Fix==

Examine the application architecture and identify any native code components. Consider replacing any native code components with Java equivalents. One reason to keep native code components is if they carry out simple but performance-sensitive operations. Avoid using native code in the future. Weigh the risks of additional vulnerabilities against the performance benefits when considering using native code.

Verify that sensitive data is not cached.

==Why==

Avoid caching sensitive data to prevent this data from falling into the wrong hands if the device is stolen or compromised.

==How to Check==

To verify that sensitive data is not cached:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of types of sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:
#* Passwords
#* Encryption keys
#* Personal information
# **Identify code that creates temporary files used by the application.** Review the application source code to find functions that are responsible for creating the temporary files to find ones that write sensitive data.
# **Verify that sensitive data is not cached.** Examine the code that creates temporary files used by the application to make sure that sensitive data is not stored in them.

==How to Fix==

To prevent caching of sensitive data:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of types of sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:
#* Passwords
#* Encryption keys
#* Personal information
# **Identify code that creates temporary files used by the application.** Review the application source code to find functions that are responsible for creating the temporary files to find ones that write sensitive data.
# **Remove code that writes sensitive data to temporary files.** Edit the functions that write sensitive data to temporary files to prevent caching of sensitive data.

Verify that location data is not logged.

==Why==

Logging location data is likely to raise privacy concerns among users.

==How to Check==

To verify that location data is not logged:

# **Identify whether the application uses location services.**
# **Determine how location services are used.** Trace location data from source to sink and record each operation performed on it.
# **Verify that location data is not logged.** Examine the trace of location data from source to sink to make sure that location data is not being logged either on the device or on any remote server.

==How to Fix==

If your application uses location data, do not store it in files and do not send it to remote servers.
